These allow for variable numbers of active features per token, framing the token-feature matching as a resource allocation problem with a total sparsity upper bound. The FC approach allows each feature to select m tokens to process, where m = M/F (M is total matches, F is number of features). MC combines aspects of FC and token choice. A new aux_zipf_loss is introduced to encourage feature densities to follow a Zipf distribution, mitigating feature under-utilization. The paper also suggests a phased training approach, starting with MC and transitioning to FC.', 'Research_Impact': 'A key challenge in mechanistic interpretability is extracting meaningful, interpretable features from neural networks while maintaining computational efficiency.

The method introduces a batch dependency during training, which is addressed during inference by estimating a global threshold parameter. This threshold is calculated as the average of minimum positive activation values across multiple batches. The SAE is trained on language model activations (e.g., from the residual stream) using a large text corpus. The loss function combines L2 reconstruction error with an L0 sparsity penalty.

After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.
YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.
You can then implement the next thing on your list.
Currently on iteration 0 of run 1
I'll plan out the experiments to implement and evaluate Clustered Sparse Autoencoders. Here's the experimental plan:

For Run 1, I've made the following changes:                                                                                                                                        

 1 Added clustering functionality in plot.py using KMeans

    • Collect sample activations from each layer                                                                                                                                   
    • Perform clustering into 2 initial clusters                                                                                                                                   
    • Train one SAE per cluster                                                                                                                                                    
    • Track and save cluster metrics                                                                                                                                               
 3 Added visualization and metrics tracking                                                                                                                                        
 4 Updated notes.txt with Run 1 description                                                                                                                                        

The clustering approach uses activation statistics (mean and std) to group similar layers. For the initial run, we're using 2 clusters to test the basic concept. The results will 
help us determine if we should adjust the number of clusters in Run 2.                                                                                                             

To run this experiment:                                                                                                                                                            

                                                                                                                                                                                   
 python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                   

After we get the results from Run 1, we can analyze the cluster assignments and metrics to plan the specific parameters for Run 2.

coder_out: The error suggests an issue with the activation buffer indexing. Let's modify the experiment.py file to handle the activations more carefully. Here are the necessary changes:

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        activations_dict[layer] = next(buffer)
=======
        # Get a batch of activations and ensure proper shape
        batch = next(buffer)
        if isinstance(batch, tuple):
            batch = batch[0]  # Get first element if tuple
        activations_dict[layer] = batch.detach()  # Detach from computation graph
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    # Train SAE on concatenated activations from all layers in cluster
    sae = run_sae_training(
        layer=representative_layer,  # Use first layer for config

        num_tokens=num_tokens,
        out_dir=f"{save_dir}/cluster_{cluster_idx}",
        device=device,
        model_name=model_name,
        context_length=128,
        buffer_size=2048,
        llm_batch_size=llm_batch_size,
        sae_batch_size=2048,
        learning_rate=3e-4,

    )

    try:
        # Train SAE on concatenated activations from all layers in cluster
        sae = run_sae_training(
            layer=representative_layer,  # Use first layer for config
            dict_size=d_model,
            num_tokens=num_tokens,
            out_dir=f"{save_dir}/cluster_{cluster_idx}",

            wandb_entity=None,
            wandb_project=None
        )
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error training SAE for cluster {cluster_idx}: {str(e)}")
        continue
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Add proper handling of activation buffer output which may be a tuple
2. Detach activations from computation graph to prevent memory issues
3. Add error handling around SAE training to prevent crashes

Try running the experiment again with:

```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1

The error suggests an issue with the activation buffer handling. Let's modify the experiment.py file to better handle the activation tensors:
