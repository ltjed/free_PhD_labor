Implement phased training with Mutual Choice followed by Feature Choice', 'Technical_Details': 'The paper proposes two novel sparse autoencoder (SAE) variants: Feature Choice (FC) and Mutual Choice (MC). These allow for variable numbers of active features per token, framing the token-feature matching as a resource allocation problem with a total sparsity upper bound. The FC approach allows each feature to select m tokens to process, where m = M/F (M is total matches, F is number of features). MC combines aspects of FC and token choice. A new aux_zipf_loss is introduced to encourage feature densities to follow a Zipf distribution, mitigating feature under-utilization. The paper also suggests a phased training approach, starting with MC and transitioning to FC.', 'Research_Impact': 'A key challenge in mechanistic interpretability is extracting meaningful, interpretable features from neural networks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Analyze latent activation patterns and flexibility in latent allocation.', 'Technical_Details': 'BatchTopK is a novel training method for Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that replaces the sample-level TopK operation with a batch-level constraint. Instead of enforcing a fixed number of active latents per sample, BatchTopK selects the top activations across the entire batch. This allows for variable sparsity per sample, with some samples using more latents and others using fewer. The method introduces a batch dependency during training, which is addressed during inference by estimating a global threshold parameter. This threshold is calculated as the average of minimum positive activation values across multiple batches. The SAE is trained on language model activations (e.g., from the residual stream) using a large text corpus. The loss function combines L2 reconstruction error with an L0 sparsity penalty.

After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.
YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.
You can then implement the next thing on your list.
Currently on iteration 0 of run 1
Let me plan the experiments to implement Multi-Scale Temporal Sparse Autoencoders for Efficient Unlearning. Given we have up to 5 runs, here's my proposed plan:           

Run 1: Implement basic temporal architecture                                                                                                                               

 • Add dilated depth-wise convolutions to capture multi-scale temporal patterns                                                                                            
 • Use dilation rates [1, 2, 4] for different temporal scales                                                                                                              
 • Keep other parameters same as baseline for comparison                                                                                                                   

Run 2: Add cosine-based feature separation loss                                                                                                                            

 • Implement cosine similarity loss between features at different time steps                                                                                               
 • Weight: 0.1 for feature separation loss                                                                                                                                 
 • Keep temporal convolutions from Run 1                                                                                                                                   

Run 3: Optimize temporal architecture                                                                                                                                      

 • Increase dilation rates to [1, 3, 9] for wider temporal context                                                                                                         
 • Add residual connections between temporal scales                                                                                                                        
 • Keep feature separation loss from Run 2                                                                                                                                 

Run 4: Final tuned model                                                                                                                                                   

 • Use best performing architecture from Runs 1-3                                                                                                                          
 • Add gradient clipping for stability                                                                                                                                     
 • Increase training tokens to 200k for better convergence                                                                                                                 

Let's start with Run 1 by implementing the temporal architecture. I'll need to modify the CustomSAE class to add temporal processing.

After seeing the results, we can proceed with Run 2 to add the feature separation loss. Would you like me to proceed with these changes?

Ah yes, I see the error. We renamed the class from CustomTrainer to TemporalTrainer but missed updating this reference. Let me fix that:

This change aligns with the class renaming we did earlier. The error occurred because we renamed the class but didn't update all references to it. This should resolve the 
undefined name error.                                                                                                                                                      

Let me know if you'd like me to check for any other references that might need updating!
