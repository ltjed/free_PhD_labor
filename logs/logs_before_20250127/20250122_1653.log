The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

The method introduces a batch dependency during training, which is addressed during inference by estimating a global threshold parameter. This threshold is calculated as the average of minimum positive activation values across multiple batches. The SAE is trained on language model activations (e.g., from the residual stream) using a large text corpus. The loss function combines L2 reconstruction error with an L0 sparsity penalty. Experiments were conducted on GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B models, using dictionary sizes of 3072, 6144, 12288, and 24576, with a bandwidth parameter of 0.001 and the Adam optimizer (learning rate 3e-4).", "Research_Impact": "A significant challenge in mechanistic interpretability is developing methods to effectively analyze and interpret the internal representations of large language models.

reasoning_content is Alright, let me think through this. The user wants a new idea for improving sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to enhance interpretability, specifically targeting the SCR and TPP benchmarks. The existing ideas like Matryoshka SAE, Gated SAE, and others have addressed various aspects like sparsity, feature absorption, and scalability. 

The core problem here is polysemanticity in SAE latents. The previous approaches tried different activation functions, training procedures, and architectural changes. But SCR and TPP require the SAE to disentangle features so that ablating specific latents cleanly removes a concept without affecting others. 

Looking at the SCR benchmark: it's about removing spurious correlations by ablating certain latents. If the SAE has latents that are more monosemantic, then ablating gender-related features should not affect profession classification. Similarly, TPP measures how ablating a set of latents affects only the targeted class probe.

So, the key is to ensure that each latent in the SAE corresponds to a single, clear concept. How can we enforce this? Existing methods use sparsity penalties, but maybe adding a contrastive loss could help. Contrastive learning encourages similar inputs to have similar features and dissimilar ones to differ. Applying this to SAE latents might push features to be more distinct and less polysemantic.

Another angle: hierarchical features. Concepts can be hierarchical (e.g., "mammal" includes "dog"). Current SAEs might merge these into a single latent. A hierarchical SAE could separate levels of abstraction, making it easier to ablate higher-level concepts without affecting lower ones.

Wait, the user mentioned the problem of feature absorption, where a latent absorbs related features. To prevent this, maybe introducing a penalty for feature overlap or encouraging orthogonality in the decoder weights. Orthogonal features are less likely to interfere, which could reduce polysemanticity.

Alternatively, using capsule networks' ideas, where each latent is encouraged to represent an entity and its properties. Capsules use dynamic routing to ensure that lower-level features are routed to higher-level capsules. Adapting this to SAEs might help in separating features.

But how feasible is that? Capsule networks are more complex. Maybe a simpler approach is better. Let me focus on contrastive learning. If during training, for each input activation, we sample another activation from a different context and minimize their feature similarity, that could encourage latents to fire only on specific concepts.

For example, for a given input, take another input that's semantically different (e.g., different gender or profession). The contrastive loss would push their SAE features to be different. This might help in disentangling gender and profession features, making them separate in the latent space.

But how to implement this? The SAE's loss function would have the standard reconstruction and sparsity terms, plus a contrastive term. The challenge is efficiently sampling positive and negative pairs. Maybe using the existing dataset's labels (like gender and profession in Bias in Bios) to create pairs. For each sample, a positive pair could be another sample with the same profession but different gender, and vice versa. The contrastive loss would then encourage gender-related latents to be similar for same-gender samples and different otherwise, while profession latents do the same for profession.

This approach could lead to more disentangled latents, which would improve SCR and TPP scores. When ablating gender latents, the profession classifier isn't affected because they're separated. Similarly, in TPP, ablating class-specific latents would only affect that class's probe.

Now, considering implementation. The SAE code in experiment.py uses a CustomSAE class with encode, decode, and forward methods. The trainer handles the loss computation. To add a contrastive loss, I'd need to modify the loss function in the trainer. 

The steps would be:
1. Modify the SAE to output the latent activations.
2. In the trainer's loss function, for each batch, sample positive and negative pairs based on the dataset's labels (gender, profession).
3. Compute a contrastive loss term that encourages similar pairs to have similar activations and dissimilar pairs to differ.
4. Combine this with the existing reconstruction and sparsity losses.

However, the current setup uses the Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews datasets, which have the necessary labels. For the ContrastiveSAE, during training, each batch would include samples with known labels. The contrastive loss would require pairs, which might need modifying the data loading to include label information.

Potential issues: 
- Increased computational cost due to pair sampling.
- Need to handle label information in the activation buffer.
- Tuning the contrastive loss weight to balance with other terms.

But given the code structure, it's feasible. The ActivationBuffer would need to provide not just activations but also the corresponding labels. Then, in the trainer's update step, for each activation in the batch, find other activations with the same or different labels to form pairs.

Another consideration: the contrastive loss could be applied to the latent features (post-activation) or the encoder outputs (pre-activation). Applying it post-ReLU (on the activated features) might be better, as those are sparse and more semantically meaningful.

In terms of research impact, this should directly target the SCR and TPP benchmarks by encouraging feature disentanglement. If latents are more monosemantic, ablating them would precisely remove a concept without affecting others, leading to higher SHIFT and TPP scores.

Testing this would involve training the ContrastiveSAE, then evaluating on SCR and TPP. If the normalized SHIFT score (S_SHIFT) improves compared to baseline SAEs, it indicates better feature separation.

Possible challenges:
- Selecting the right contrastive margin and loss scaling.
- Ensuring that the added loss doesn't interfere with reconstruction or sparsity.
- Efficient pair sampling without excessive memory usage.

But given that the code already handles batches, pairing within a batch is manageable. For each sample in the batch, use its label to find others in the same batch for contrastive pairs. This avoids needing to store extra data.

Overall, the idea is novel as it introduces contrastive learning into SAE training, which hasn't been explored in the existing ideas. It's feasible with moderate code changes and should directly address the target benchmarks by reducing polysemanticity.
content is THOUGHT:
The key insight is that contrastive learning can encourage feature disentanglement in SAE latents by pushing semantically distinct concepts apart in the latent space. Unlike existing approaches that focus solely on reconstruction and sparsity, this method explicitly optimizes for conceptual separation through contrastive pairs. By sampling positive pairs (same semantic concept) and negative pairs (different concepts) from labeled datasets like Bias in Bios, we can add a contrastive loss term that penalizes similar latent activations for dissimilar concepts. This should reduce polysemanticity by forcing the SAE to maintain separate feature directions for orthogonal concepts like gender and profession. The approach differs from previous work by directly incorporating concept relationships into the training objective rather than relying solely on sparsity constraints.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

THOUGHT:
The key insight is that contrastive learning can encourage feature disentanglement in SAE latents by pushing semantically distinct concepts apart in the latent space. Unlike existing approaches that focus solely on reconstruction and sparsity, this method explicitly optimizes for conceptual separation through contrastive pairs. By sampling positive pairs (same semantic concept) and negative pairs (different concepts) from labeled datasets like Bias in Bios, we can add a contrastive loss term that penalizes similar latent activations for dissimilar concepts. This should reduce polysemanticity by forcing the SAE to maintain separate feature directions for orthogonal concepts like gender and profession.
