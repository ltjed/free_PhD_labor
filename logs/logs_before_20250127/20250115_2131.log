*Starting Experiments*
Starting experiment with prompt for coder: Your goal is to implement the following idea: Information-Theoretic Hierarchical Temporal Consistency for Sparse Autoencoder Disentanglement.
The proposed experiment is as follows: 1. Implement spectral clustering for temporal hierarchy
2. Add LSH-based similarity computation
3. Implement information bottleneck loss
4. Train on Gemma-2B with gradient checkpointing
5. Evaluate with expanded metrics suite
6. Perform causal intervention studies.
You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.

First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.

Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.

For reference, the baseline results are as follows:

After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.

You can then implement the next thing on your list.
