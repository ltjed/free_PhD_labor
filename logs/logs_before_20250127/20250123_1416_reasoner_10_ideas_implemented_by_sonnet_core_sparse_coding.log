THOUGHT:
The idea proposes using Nyström approximation methods for sparse autoencoders with momentum-based feature resampling. This combines numerical linear algebra optimization techniques with SAE training. I should check if there are existing papers that use Nyström methods specifically for sparse autoencoders or similar neural network interpretability tasks. Let me search for papers combining Nyström approximation with sparse autoencoders or feature learning.

THOUGHT:
From the search results, while there are papers using sparse autoencoders for various applications and some papers using Nyström approximation for other machine learning tasks, none specifically combine Nyström approximation with sparse autoencoders for interpretability purposes. The closest work (FinSafeNet) uses Nyström approximation with PCA, not autoencoders. Let me do one more search specifically focusing on spectral regularization and feature disentanglement in autoencoders to ensure there isn't prior work in that direction.

THOUGHT:
After reviewing the search results, while there are papers on spectral regularization in autoencoders (like SRUN and Graph Regularized Autoencoder) and papers on orthogonality constraints, none combine Nyström approximation with sparse autoencoders specifically for interpretability and feature disentanglement. The unique aspects of this proposal are: 1) Using Nyström method for efficient SVD computation in SAEs, 2) The momentum-based feature resampling approach, and 3) The specific application to neural network interpretability. Let me do one final search focusing specifically on neural network interpretability methods with SVD approximations to be thorough.

THOUGHT:
The idea proposes integrating activation sparsity statistics with randomized orthogonalization in sparse autoencoders. The key novelty claim is using activation frequencies to adaptively weight the orthogonality constraints. Let me search for papers that might have explored similar approaches combining sparsity and orthogonalization in autoencoders or related neural network architectures. I should specifically look for works that use activation statistics to guide feature disentanglement.

I'll search for papers that combine orthogonalization, sparsity, and activation statistics in autoencoders or feature learning.

THOUGHT:
Based on the search results, several papers are highly relevant to this idea. Papers 2, 3, and 4 specifically deal with evaluating sparse autoencoders for interpretability and feature disentanglement. However, none of these papers discuss using activation frequencies to adaptively weight orthogonality constraints. Let me search specifically for papers about adaptive orthogonalization in neural networks to ensure there isn't prior work combining these concepts.

THOUGHT:
From the search results, paper #7 "Adaptive Sparse Allocation with Mutual Choice & Feature Choice Sparse Autoencoders" is relevant but focuses on different aspects of adaptive sparsity (token-feature matching). Paper #5 "TANGOS" discusses gradient orthogonalization but in a different context (tabular data). None of the papers directly address using activation frequencies to weight orthogonality constraints in sparse autoencoders or using sparse-aware random projections in the Nyström sketch. Let me do one final search focused specifically on sparse autoencoders and Nyström methods to ensure there isn't prior work combining these specific techniques.

THOUGHT:
The idea proposes several interesting modifications to sparse autoencoders: adaptive thresholds based on percentiles, orthogonality curriculum learning, and learnable scale factors. Let me search for papers specifically about curriculum learning or adaptive thresholds in sparse autoencoders, as these seem to be the core novel elements. I should check if anyone has previously applied percentile-based thresholding or curriculum-based orthogonality regularization in SAEs.

Let me search for papers that combine curriculum learning with sparse autoencoders, as this seems to be the most likely area where similar work might exist.

THOUGHT:
Looking at the search results, while there are papers that use adaptive thresholds (like papers 0, 3, and 5) and some that use sparse autoencoders (like papers 2 and 6), none of them combine these concepts in the way proposed. Most importantly, none address the specific challenge of mechanistic interpretability in language models using curriculum-based orthogonality constraints with dynamic thresholds. Let me search specifically for papers about mechanistic interpretability and sparse autoencoders to ensure we haven't missed anything in that domain, as this is the primary application area.

THOUGHT:
The search results reveal significant work in sparse autoencoders for mechanistic interpretability, particularly papers 8 and 9 which establish the foundation for using SAEs to address polysemanticity. However, while these works introduce basic SAEs, none of them propose the specific combination of adaptive thresholds with curriculum-based orthogonality constraints that our idea suggests. Paper 7 (End-to-End SAE) comes closest by focusing on functional importance, but uses a different approach based on KL divergence. The use of percentile-based thresholds and learnable scale factors with curriculum learning appears to be novel. Let me make one final search focusing specifically on curriculum learning in SAEs to be thorough.

THOUGHT: 
This idea proposes a hierarchical sparse autoencoder with some interesting elements:
1. Geometric sparsity scaling across layers
2. Additive decoders with shared base weights
3. Progressive layer-wise training
4. Parameter-efficient design using tensor products

I should check if there are existing papers on hierarchical or progressive sparse autoencoders, particularly in the context of interpretability. The key novel aspects seem to be the geometric sparsity scaling and shared base weights approach.

Let me search for papers about hierarchical sparse autoencoders and progressive training to establish novelty.

From the search results, I see several relevant papers but none that directly overlap with the core novelty of this proposal. While there are papers on hierarchical sparse autoencoders (like papers #1, #2, and #6), they don't use the geometric sparsity scaling or shared base weights approach proposed here. 

Paper #2 about layer-wise transfer learning in SAEs is somewhat related but focuses on transfer learning rather than curriculum learning. Paper #5 about principled evaluations of SAEs is important context but doesn't propose a similar architecture.

Let me do one more search specifically for papers about curriculum learning or progressive training in sparse autoencoders, as this is another key aspect of the proposal.

THOUGHT:
The idea proposes several interesting optimizations for hierarchical sparse autoencoders, particularly using low-rank SVD approximations for cross-covariance and exponential sparsity scaling. The key novelty claims are around the integration of these techniques for scalable hierarchical feature learning. Let me first search for existing work on hierarchical sparse autoencoders and covariance-based regularization to assess overlap.

I should search for papers that combine hierarchical sparse autoencoders with covariance alignment or similar regularization techniques. A good starting point would be searching for "hierarchical sparse autoencoder covariance alignment" to see if this combination has been explored before.
