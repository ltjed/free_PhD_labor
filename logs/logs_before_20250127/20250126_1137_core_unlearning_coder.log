THOUGHT:
The prototype idea of using orthogonal feature learning in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) is promising, but it can be refined to better address the specific challenge of polysemanticity in latent representations. My proposed idea builds on the prototype by introducing **dynamic feature grouping** and **adaptive sparsity constraints** to further disentangle polysemantic features. The key intuition is that polysemanticity arises not just from feature overlap but also from the lack of explicit separation between semantically distinct but correlated features. By dynamically grouping features based on their activation patterns and applying adaptive sparsity constraints, we can encourage the SAE to learn more interpretable, monosemantic latents.

The high-level plan involves:
1. **Dynamic Feature Grouping**: Periodically cluster latents based on their activation patterns to identify correlated features. This allows the SAE to explicitly separate features that are semantically distinct but often co-occur.
2. **Adaptive Sparsity Constraints**: Adjust the sparsity penalty for each latent based on its activation frequency and correlation with other latents. This ensures that rare but important features are not suppressed by the sparsity penalty.
3. **Controlled Feature Sharing**: Introduce a controlled feature-sharing mechanism that allows latents within the same group to share information while maintaining separation between groups.

The ideal outcome is a set of latents that are more interpretable and less polysemantic, as measured by the sparse_probing benchmark. This approach refines the prototype by focusing on the specific challenge of polysemanticity without introducing unnecessary complexity. The modifications are computationally efficient and can be implemented within the existing framework.
