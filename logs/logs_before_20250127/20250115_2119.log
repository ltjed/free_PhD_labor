After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.
YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.
You can then implement the next thing on your list.
Currently on iteration 0 of run 1
I'll help plan and implement the temporal consistency experiments. Here's the proposed plan for the runs:               

Run 1 (Already done): Baseline vanilla SAE                                                                              

 • Standard L1 + reconstruction loss                                                                                    
 • Results provided in notes.txt                                                                                        

Run 2: Initial temporal consistency implementation                                                                      

 • Add temporal consistency loss with moderate weight (0.1)                                                             
 • Modify training to process sequential activations                                                                    
 • Focus on basic implementation and validation                                                                         

Run 3: Strong temporal consistency                                                                                      

 • Increase temporal consistency weight to 0.5                                                                          
 • Keep other parameters same as Run 2                                                                                  
 • Test impact of stronger temporal regularization                                                                      

Run 4: Weak temporal consistency                                                                                        

 • Decrease temporal consistency weight to 0.01                                                                         
 • Keep other parameters same as Run 2                                                                                  
 • Test impact of lighter temporal regularization                                                                       

Run 5: Best performing configuration                                                                                    

 • Based on results from runs 2-4, use the best performing temporal consistency weight                                  
 • Add any optimizations identified from previous runs                                                                  

Let's start with Run 2 by implementing the temporal consistency modifications. I'll need to:                            

 1 Modify the CustomSAE class to track temporal information                                                             
 2 Add temporal consistency loss                                                                                        
 3 Update the training loop to handle sequential data                                                                   

Here are the changes for Run 2:

 Configuration:                                                                                                         
 - Added temporal consistency loss (weight=0.1)                                                                         
 - Modified training to process sequential activations                                                                  
 - Tracking temporal feature stability                                                                                  
                                                                                                                        
 Hypothesis:                                                                                                            
 - Temporal consistency loss should improve feature stability across sequential tokens                                  
 - May see slight decrease in reconstruction quality due to additional constraint                                       
 - Expect more consistent feature activations for related tokens                                                        
 >>>>>>> REPLACE                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                        

This implements the basic temporal consistency mechanism by:                                                            

 1 Tracking previous encoded features                                                                                   
 2 Adding temporal consistency loss that penalizes large changes in feature activations                                 
 3 Using a moderate weight of 0.1 for the temporal loss term                                                            

The temporal loss encourages features to remain stable when processing sequential tokens, while still allowing them to  
change when needed through the reconstruction loss.                                                                     

Let's run this initial implementation and analyze its impact on feature stability and interpretability. We can then     
adjust the temporal weight in subsequent runs based on these results.

I see the issue - we renamed the trainer class to TemporalTrainer but missed updating the reference to it. Here's the   
fix:
