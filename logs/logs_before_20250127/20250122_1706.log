The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

reasoning_content is Okay, I need to come up with a new idea for improving sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to address polysemanticity and improve performance on the SCR and TPP benchmarks. Let's start by understanding the problem again. The core issue is that individual latent features in SAEs can represent multiple concepts (polysemanticity), which makes them less interpretable. The existing approaches like Matryoshka SAE or adaptive sparse autoencoders try to handle this by adjusting sparsity or architecture. 

Looking at the SCR benchmark, the key is to have SAE latents that separate spurious correlations, like gender and profession. If the SAE can disentangle these features, ablating the gender-related latents should improve the classifier's accuracy on profession by removing the spurious signal. Similarly, for TPP, we need latents that affect only their target class probes without influencing others.

So, how can we modify SAEs to get more monosemantic features? One angle is to enforce that each latent feature is more specialized. Maybe introducing a contrastive loss that pushes features to be distinct from each other. Or perhaps using some form of mutual information minimization between features. 

Wait, the existing ideas include things like adaptive computation, gating, clustering, etc. The mutual feature regularization idea already tries to encourage features to be present across different SAEs. But maybe we need something that enforces feature separation within a single SAE. 

What if we use a contrastive loss term during training? For each input, the activated features should be as dissimilar as possible. That way, each feature is encouraged to respond to distinct patterns. But how to implement this? Maybe for each batch, compute pairwise similarities between the feature activations and penalize high similarities. This would push the features to be orthogonal or at least less correlated.

Alternatively, consider adding a diversity regularization term. For example, penalize the cosine similarity between the decoder weights of different features. This would encourage the features to represent different directions in the activation space. However, this might not directly address polysemanticity in the activations themselves, since the decoder weights' diversity doesn't ensure that the activations are monosemantic.

Another angle: during training, when a feature activates, we can sample negative examples where that feature should not activate, and enforce a margin. This is similar to contrastive learning. For instance, for each active feature in a batch, find other inputs where that feature isn't active and ensure that the feature's activation is lower in those cases. This could help features become more specific.

Wait, perhaps a supervised approach could help, but the challenge is that we don't have labels. However, in the SCR and TPP benchmarks, the evaluation uses probes for specific classes. Maybe during training, we can use the probe signals as auxiliary tasks to guide the SAE features to align with these concepts. But that might require labeled data, which isn't always available. 

Alternatively, use an unsupervised method that encourages each feature to have high mutual information with a subset of the input but low mutual information with other features. This is similar to independent component analysis. But implementing mutual information in high dimensions is tricky.

Hmm, maybe a simpler approach is to modify the loss function to include a term that penalizes features that activate together frequently. For example, if two features often fire on the same inputs, their co-activation is penalized. This would encourage features to be more independent. 

Another idea: hierarchical SAEs. First, learn higher-level features, then within each, learn more specific sub-features. This could help disentangle hierarchical concepts. But integrating this into existing SAE frameworks might be complex.

Wait, the Matryoshka SAE uses nested dictionaries. Maybe combining that with some form of diversity regularization could help. For instance, each nested level enforces more specific features, and the diversity loss ensures they don't overlap.

Alternatively, use a mixture of experts approach where each expert is encouraged to specialize in a particular type of feature. The gating network routes inputs to the most relevant experts, which could lead to more specialized features. The Switch SAE idea mentioned earlier does something similar, but maybe adding a diversity term to the experts' weights could enhance feature separation.

Let me focus on the SCR and TPP metrics. For SCR, the key is that ablating certain features (e.g., gender) removes the spurious correlation without affecting the main task (e.g., profession). If the SAE features are more disentangled, then selecting the gender-related features via the probe should be more precise, leading to better ablation results. 

So, the proposed SAE variant needs to produce features that are more aligned with individual concepts. Maybe using a combination of sparsity and some form of feature decorrelation. For example, adding a term to the loss that minimizes the covariance between different features' activations. This would reduce redundancy and make each feature capture unique information.

Covariance regularization: The idea is that the activations of different features should be uncorrelated. The loss could include the Frobenius norm of the covariance matrix of the features' activations, encouraging them to be decorrelated. This would help in reducing feature absorption and polysemanticity because features that are decorrelated are less likely to overlap in the concepts they represent.

Let's formalize this. Let F be the matrix of feature activations for a batch (batch_size x num_features). The covariance matrix C is (F - mean(F))^T (F - mean(F)) / (batch_size - 1). The regularization term would be the sum of the off-diagonal elements squared, which is the squared Frobenius norm of C minus the sum of the variances. By penalizing this term, the model is encouraged to have features with activations that are uncorrelated.

This approach directly targets the co-activation of features, which is a source of polysemanticity. If two features are often active together, their covariance would be high, and the regularization would push them to be less correlated. This should lead to features that are more independent and thus more monosemantic.

Now, considering implementation. The existing SAE code uses a standard L1 penalty for sparsity. Adding the covariance regularization term would involve computing the covariance matrix of the encoded features for each batch and adding its Frobenius norm (minus diagonals) to the loss. The gradient of this term with respect to the encoder weights can be computed via backpropagation.

Potential challenges include the computational cost of computing the covariance matrix, especially for a large number of features. However, since the batch size is manageable (e.g., 2048 in the code), and the number of features is in the thousands, this should be feasible.

Another consideration is the weighting of the covariance term relative to the L1 and L2 losses. It would require tuning the hyperparameter for this term to balance sparsity, reconstruction, and decorrelation.

In terms of the experiment, the steps would involve modifying the loss function in the SAE training code to include the covariance regularization. Then, training the SAE with this new loss and evaluating on the SCR and TPP benchmarks. The expectation is that the decorrelated features would lead to better disentanglement, thus higher SCR and TPP scores.

Comparing to existing ideas: The mutual feature regularization idea encourages features across different SAEs to be similar, but this idea focuses on reducing covariance within a single SAE. The adaptive and gated SAEs adjust sparsity but don't explicitly address feature correlations. This approach is novel in directly targeting feature co-activation patterns.

For the implementation plan, in the existing code, the loss is computed in the `loss` method of the CustomTrainer class. We can modify this to compute the covariance matrix of the activations (after ReLU) and add the Frobenius norm of the off-diagonal elements as a regularization term. The hyperparameter for the covariance penalty would need to be introduced and tuned.

Testing feasibility: The covariance computation is O(batch_size * num_features^2), which for num_features=512 and batch_size=2048 is manageable on an H100. The rest of the training loop remains the same. So, the code modification is minor but requires careful implementation.

Potential hyperparameters to tune: the weight of the covariance term. Starting with a small value (e.g., 1e-3) and adjusting based on validation metrics.

Now, let's structure this into the JSON format.

Title: Covariance-Regularized Sparse Autoencoders for Disentangled Feature Learning

Experiment: 
1. Modify SAE loss function to include a covariance regularization term on feature activations.
2. Train SAEs with varying strengths of covariance regularization on language model activations.
3. Evaluate feature interpretability using SCR and TPP benchmarks.
4. Compare against baseline SAEs without covariance regularization.
5. Analyze feature activation covariance matrices to measure decorrelation.
6. Perform ablation studies on the effect of covariance regularization strength.

Technical_Details: The covariance-regularized SAE introduces an additional loss term that penalizes the covariance between different feature activations. For a batch of activations F ∈ R^{B×D} (B=batch size, D=number of features), compute the empirical covariance matrix C = (F^T F - (1/B)(F^T 1)(1^T F))/(B-1). The regularization term is λ * ||C - diag(C)||_F^2, where ||·||_F is the Frobenius norm and λ is a hyperparameter. This term encourages features to have uncorrelated activations, reducing polysemanticity by preventing multiple features from responding to the same input patterns. The total loss becomes L = L_reconstruction + αL_sparsity + βL_covariance, where α and β are regularization coefficients.

Research_Impact: By explicitly decorrelating feature activations, this approach directly targets the root cause of polysemanticity in SAEs. For the SCR benchmark, reduced feature covariance means gender and profession features are less entangled, enabling more precise ablation of spurious signals. In TPP, decorrelated features will have isolated impacts on specific class probes, improving the mean accuracy difference metric. This method addresses superposition by enforcing statistical independence between learned features, a key requirement for interpretable disentanglement.

Implementation_Plan: 
1. In the CustomSAE's loss function, compute the covariance matrix of the encoded features (after ReLU).
2. Calculate the Frobenius norm of the off-diagonal elements.
3. Add this as a regularization term to the total loss with a tunable coefficient.
4. Modify the trainer to include the new hyperparameter for covariance regularization.
5. Update the training loop to compute and log the covariance loss term.
6. Run experiments with different λ values and evaluate on SCR and TPP metrics.

Interestingness_Evaluation: The idea is interesting as it directly addresses feature entanglement through a novel regularization approach not present in existing SAE variants.  
Interestingness: 8

Feasibility_Evaluation: The implementation requires adding a covariance term to the loss, which is computationally feasible given batch sizes and feature dimensions typical in SAE training. The code changes are localized to the loss computation, making it manageable within a month. Training time remains similar as covariance computation is O(D²B), which is acceptable on H100.  
Feasibility: 8

Novelty_Evaluation: While covariance regularization is known in other contexts, its application to SAEs for interpretability is novel and addresses a key challenge in feature disentanglement.  
Novelty: 7

Overall_Score: (0.2*8)+(0.5*8)+(0.3*7) = 1.6 +4 +2.1=7.7 → Let the calculation be done automatically, but the score should reflect this.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

The method introduces a batch dependency during training, which is addressed during inference by estimating a global threshold parameter. This threshold is calculated as the average of minimum positive activation values across multiple batches. The SAE is trained on language model activations (e.g., from the residual stream) using a large text corpus. The loss function combines L2 reconstruction error with an L0 sparsity penalty. Experiments were conducted on GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B models, using dictionary sizes of 3072, 6144, 12288, and 24576, with a bandwidth parameter of 0.001 and the Adam optimizer (learning rate 3e-4).", "Research_Impact": "A significant challenge in mechanistic interpretability is developing methods to effectively analyze and interpret the internal representations of large language models.

This improvement in reconstruction quality, as demonstrated by lower normalized MSE and reduced cross-entropy degradation, could lead to more accurate and insightful interpretations of model behavior.

Iteration 2/2
msg_history at the start of iteration is [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Your current research focuses on addressing the challenge of limited interpretability in the latent space of sparse autoencoders. The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

new_msg_history after appending msg is [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Your current research focuses on addressing the challenge of limited interpretability in the latent space of sparse autoencoders. The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

reasoning_content is Okay, let's take another look at the idea I proposed. The covariance-regularized SAE aims to reduce feature co-activation by adding a covariance penalty. The overall score was 7.7, which is decent but needs to reach above 9. Let me analyze where I can improve.

First, the feasibility was rated 8. The main concern is the computational cost of calculating the covariance matrix for large feature dimensions. For example, with D=2048 features, the covariance matrix is 2048x2048, which is 4 million elements. Calculating this per batch might be memory-intensive. Maybe I can optimize this by using a low-rank approximation or stochastic regularization.

The novelty was 7. Covariance regularization isn't entirely new in machine learning, but applying it to SAEs for disentanglement is novel. However, to increase novelty, perhaps combining it with another technique, like dynamic regularization weights or hierarchical regularization, could make the approach more unique.

Research impact: The original idea targets SCR/TPP by reducing feature correlations. To enhance this, maybe the regularization could be adaptive—focusing more on features that are highly correlated in the data. For example, using a threshold to apply regularization only to feature pairs above a certain correlation level.

Implementation plan: The initial plan was to add covariance calculation in the loss function. To handle computational efficiency, perhaps using a sampled subset of features for regularization or using a moving average of the covariance matrix across batches could reduce memory usage.

Interestingness: The idea is interesting, but maybe integrating it with another concept, like curriculum learning where the regularization strength increases over time, could make it more compelling.

Feasibility evaluation: The original assessment considered memory for D=2048. If the feature size is larger, say 10k, this approach might not be feasible. But since the target models are Gemma-2B with hidden size 2048, it's manageable. To further ensure feasibility, using PyTorch's efficient matrix operations and gradient checkpointing could help.

Novelty: To boost novelty, introducing a learnable mask for the covariance regularization, where only certain feature pairs are penalized, could be a twist. Alternatively, using a contrastive loss between features to encourage independence.

Wait, but the user wants the overall score above 9. Let's recalculate. If I increase feasibility to 9 and novelty to 8, then overall score becomes 0.2*8 + 0.5*9 + 0.3*8 = 1.6 + 4.5 + 2.4 = 8.5. Still not 9. Need higher.

Alternative approach: Maybe combine covariance regularization with a disentangled loss structure. For example, group features into subspaces and apply within-group covariance penalties. This adds a structural component, increasing novelty.

Another angle: Use mutual information instead of covariance. But MI is harder to estimate. Alternatively, use a spectral penalty on the covariance matrix to encourage orthogonality.

Alternatively, use a sparse covariance regularization, penalizing only the top correlated pairs each batch. This reduces computation and focuses on problematic features.

Implementing a sparse approximation of the covariance penalty could make it feasible for larger dimensions and increase novelty. For example, only compute the top K correlated pairs each batch and penalize those. This reduces the O(D²) computation to O(DK), which is manageable.

Revising the technical details: Instead of full covariance, use a sparse regularization on highly correlated features. This makes the approach more scalable and novel.

Updating the experiment steps to include selecting top correlated features for regularization. This would also tie into the benchmarks, as highly correlated features are more likely to cause polysemanticity.

In the implementation plan, adding a method to select top-K correlated pairs each batch. This requires efficient sorting or thresholding but is feasible with PyTorch's tensor operations.

Research impact: By targeting the most correlated features, the regularization directly addresses the polysemanticity issue, leading to better disentanglement. This should improve SCR and TPP scores as the ablation becomes more precise.

Novelty is now higher because of the sparse regularization approach, which hasn't been applied in SAEs before. Feasibility improves as computational load is reduced.

With these changes, the overall score could reach higher. Let's adjust the JSON accordingly.
content is THOUGHT:
The original covariance regularization idea shows promise but needs refinement to achieve higher impact. By implementing sparse covariance regularization that focuses only on top-k correlated feature pairs per batch, we maintain the core concept while improving scalability and novelty. This adaptation reduces computational complexity from O(D²) to O(Dk) while directly targeting the most problematic feature interactions. The sparse approximation makes the approach feasible for larger models and adds a novel element of dynamic correlation targeting. This should better address polysemanticity in SCR/TPP benchmarks by surgically removing the most entangled feature relationships while preserving computational efficiency.

new_msg_history after appending content is [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Your current research focuses on addressing the challenge of limited interpretability in the latent space of sparse autoencoders. The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

The original covariance regularization idea shows promise but needs refinement to achieve higher impact. By implementing sparse covariance regularization that focuses only on top-k correlated feature pairs per batch, we maintain the core concept while improving scalability and novelty. This adaptation reduces computational complexity from O(D²) to O(Dk) while directly targeting the most problematic feature interactions. The sparse approximation makes the approach feasible for larger models and adds a novel element of dynamic correlation targeting.

reasoning_content is Okay, let me start by understanding the proposed idea. The core of the idea is to introduce a sparse top-K covariance regularization into sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to improve interpretability by reducing polysemanticity. The key components are:

1. **Adaptive Top-K Covariance Regularization**: They propose selecting the top-K most correlated pairs of features per batch and penalizing their covariance. This is different from full covariance regularization, which would consider all pairs, thus being computationally expensive. By focusing only on the top-K, they aim to reduce unnecessary computation while still addressing feature entanglement.

2. **Dynamic K-Selection**: The number of pairs K isn't fixed but instead increases over time using an exponential schedule. This could help in gradually introducing more regularization as training progresses, potentially avoiding early over-regularization.

3. **Impact on SCR/TPP Metrics**: The authors claim that this approach would improve SCR (by removing spurious correlations more precisely) and TPP (by better disentangling class-specific features). They also mention addressing feature absorption by preventing hierarchical merging through targeted regularization.

Now, I need to check if similar approaches exist in the literature. The main novelty here seems to be the combination of sparse covariance regularization with dynamic K selection specifically for SAEs. 

Possible search queries to check for prior work:

- "sparse covariance regularization autoencoder"
- "top-k covariance sparse autoencoder"
- "dynamic covariance regularization disentanglement"
- "sparse autoencoder feature decorrelation"

Looking at existing literature, I recall that covariance regularization has been explored in various contexts. For example, in variational autoencoders (VAEs), methods like β-VAE or FactorVAE use statistical independence of latent factors, often through covariance or mutual information penalties. However, applying this to sparse autoencoders in the context of interpretability might be new.

Another angle is the use of top-K selection in regularization. There's work on structured sparsity where only the top activations are considered, but combining that with covariance penalties for SAEs isn't something I've seen. However, I need to verify if any recent papers on SAEs have explored similar regularization techniques.

The abstract provided in the initial problem statement mentions using sparse autoencoders to resolve superposition in language models. If existing work already applies covariance-based methods to SAEs for this purpose, that would overlap. But the proposed method's dynamic and sparse approach might differentiate it.

I should check for papers that mention covariance regularization in SAEs, especially those focusing on interpretability or feature disentanglement. The query "sparse autoencoder covariance regularization" might yield relevant results. If there's a paper that introduces a similar regularization term, especially with dynamic or top-K elements, that would indicate a lack of novelty.

Assuming the Semantic Scholar API is queried with "sparse autoencoder covariance regularization", the top results would include any existing work on this topic. If no such papers are found, especially those applying top-K covariance penalties in SAEs, the idea is likely novel. However, if a paper like "Decorrelating Sparse Autoencoders for Improved Interpretability" exists, that would be a conflict.

Given that the initial problem's abstract doesn't mention covariance methods but focuses on standard sparse autoencoders, there's a chance this approach hasn't been explored yet. But without checking the literature via specific queries, it's hard to be certain. Hence, a query is necessary here to confirm novelty.

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine. The experimental results show that the proposed KT-SAE method has improved transfer accuracy compared to other related transfer learning methods.\n\n1: Estimation of sparse covariance matrix via non-convex regularization.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

reasoning_content is Alright, let's dive into this. The user's idea is about using sparse covariance regularization in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to improve interpretability by targeting the top-k most correlated feature pairs. The key components are dynamic k-selection, efficient implementation, and benchmarking against SCR/TPP metrics.

Looking at the previous search results, most papers either apply sparse regularization in different contexts (like transfer learning, seismic data, structural damage detection) or use autoencoders with other regularization types (like L1, graph Laplacian). None specifically address using top-k covariance regularization in SAEs for reducing polysemanticity. For example, paper 2 talks about sparse covariance matrices but in a statistical estimation context, not SAEs. Paper 5 uses L1 regularization in an autoencoder ensemble, which is different. Paper 8 mentions multi-domain sparsity but again not focused on covariance in SAEs.

However, there's a paper titled "Estimation of sparse covariance matrix via non-convex regularization" which is about covariance sparsity but not in the context of autoencoders or feature disentanglement. The other papers either don't combine covariance regularization with SAEs or don't target feature correlation for interpretability.

To be thorough, maybe another query like "sparse autoencoder top-k covariance regularization" could find if someone has specifically applied this technique. If no relevant papers come up, the idea might still be novel. But based on current results, it seems the approach hasn't been directly explored. Decision made: novel.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine.

However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

reasoning_content is Okay, let me think through this. The user's idea is about using sparse covariance regularization in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to improve interpretability by targeting the most correlated feature pairs. They propose a dynamic top-k selection for regularization to address issues like feature absorption and improve metrics like SCR and TPP.

Looking at the previous search results, none of the papers directly address applying sparse covariance regularization specifically in the context of SAEs for interpretability. Some papers mention sparse regularization in autoencoders, but they're focused on different applications like seismic data, mental health, or structural damage detection. The technical details of the idea—like the dynamic k adjustment and the specific loss function with top-k covariance terms—aren't covered in the found papers. 

The key novelty here seems to be combining adaptive sparse covariance regularization with SAEs to target feature correlations efficiently. Since the prior searches didn't find papers that do this exact approach, especially in the context of mechanistic interpretability of language models, the idea might still be novel. However, to be thorough, maybe a more targeted query is needed. Perhaps searching for "sparse autoencoder covariance regularization interpretability" or similar terms could check if any recent work in the interpretability literature has done this. 

But given the previous queries didn't find relevant papers, and the current query returned nothing, it's possible this specific approach hasn't been explored. The core contribution—dynamic top-k covariance regularization for SAEs—isn't mentioned in the existing literature presented. So, unless there's a paper specifically applying this technique to SAEs for interpretability, the idea is novel. Since the last query found no papers, and the others didn't hit the mark, I can lean towards the idea being novel now.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Ni\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2108631516\', \'name\': \'Li-Xin Wang\'}]. Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 2020.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: In sparse DOA estimation methods, the regularization parameter λ is generally empirically tuned. In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 2020.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: In sparse DOA estimation methods, the regularization parameter λ is generally empirically tuned. In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine.

However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

reasoning_content is Okay, let's go through this step by step. The user's idea is about using sparse covariance regularization in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to improve interpretability of latent features. The key components are: 1) applying a top-K covariance regularization to target the most correlated feature pairs, 2) dynamic adjustment of K during training, and 3) evaluating using SCR and TPP metrics.

Looking at the previous queries and results, the initial search for "sparse autoencoder covariance regularization" returned papers that mention sparse autoencoders and regularization, but none specifically addressing covariance regularization for feature disentanglement in SAEs. The second query attempt didn't find any papers either. 

The existing papers found discuss applications like transfer learning, seismic data, structural damage detection, mental health analysis, etc., but none focus on using sparse covariance regularization to address polysemanticity or feature absorption in SAEs for interpretability. Some mention regularization techniques like L1 or graph Laplacian, but not covariance-based or dynamic top-K selection.

Now, considering the core idea again: targeting the most correlated features each batch with a dynamic K schedule. The key innovation here is the combination of covariance regularization with adaptive sparsity (selecting top-K pairs) and integrating this into SAE training for better disentanglement. The prior works don't seem to tackle this specific approach. 

Since the previous searches didn't find overlapping work, and the specific technique (adaptive top-K covariance regularization in SAEs) isn't covered in the retrieved papers, it seems novel. However, to be thorough, maybe another query using terms like "sparse autoencoder dynamic covariance regularization" or checking recent papers on feature disentanglement in SAEs could help confirm. But given the prior results, it's likely the idea is novel.

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine.

However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine. The experimental results show that the proposed KT-SAE method has improved transfer accuracy compared to other related transfer learning methods.\n\n1: Estimation of sparse covariance matrix via non-convex regularization.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

reasoning_content is Okay, let's go through this step by step. The user's idea is about using a sparse top-k covariance regularization in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to improve interpretability of latent features by reducing polysemanticity. The key components are dynamically selecting the top-k most correlated feature pairs to regularize, which aims to decorrelate features and prevent issues like feature absorption. They also mention specific benchmarks like SCR and TPP to evaluate the effectiveness.

Looking at the previous queries and results, the initial search for "sparse autoencoder covariance regularization" returned several papers, but none that specifically address using top-k covariance regularization in SAEs for disentangling features. The papers found were in different application areas like seismic data, structural damage detection, or mental health analysis, but none focused on the core idea of dynamically targeting the most correlated pairs in SAEs for interpretability.

In the subsequent rounds, when the user queried again and got "No papers found," it suggests that the more specific terms might not be present in existing literature. The key differentiators here are the adaptive selection of top-k correlations per batch and the dynamic adjustment of k during training. 

To ensure thoroughness, maybe a different query could help. Perhaps searching for "top-k covariance regularization autoencoder" or "dynamic covariance regularization sparse autoencoder" might find more relevant papers. But given that the previous searches didn't turn up anything directly related, it's possible this specific approach hasn't been explored yet.

The existing literature uses covariance regularization but not in the targeted, adaptive way proposed here. For example, some papers apply L1 regularization or other sparse methods, but not focusing on the top-k correlations dynamically. The combination of sparsity in both activations and covariance regularization, along with the dynamic k adjustment, seems novel.

Therefore, after checking multiple queries and not finding overlapping work, the idea appears novel. Decision made: novel.

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine.

However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine. The experimental results show that the proposed KT-SAE method has improved transfer accuracy compared to other related transfer learning methods.\n\n1: Estimation of sparse covariance matrix via non-convex regularization.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Ni\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2108631516\', \'name\': \'Li-Xin Wang\'}]. Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine. The experimental results show that the proposed KT-SAE method has improved transfer accuracy compared to other related transfer learning methods.\n\n1: Estimation of sparse covariance matrix via non-convex regularization.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 2020.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: In sparse DOA estimation methods, the regularization parameter λ is generally empirically tuned. In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

reasoning_content is Okay, so the user has this idea about using sparse covariance regularization in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to improve interpretability by targeting the most correlated feature pairs. They've already done a couple of rounds of queries looking for existing literature, but the papers found don't seem to directly address their specific approach. 

Let me think. The key components here are the use of top-k covariance regularization with dynamic k adjustment in the context of SAEs for disentangling features. The previous searches using terms like "sparse autoencoder covariance regularization" didn't turn up anything directly related. The papers found either apply autoencoders in different domains (like seismic data or mental health) or use different regularization techniques (like L1, graph Laplacian, or non-negative constraints). None of them specifically mention using a top-k selection on the covariance matrix to regularize only the most correlated pairs, nor the dynamic adjustment of k during training.

Maybe I should check if there's any work on sparse covariance regularization in the context of autoencoders, particularly those focused on interpretability or feature disentanglement. Another angle could be looking into recent papers that combine sparsity and covariance penalties in neural networks. Perhaps a more specific query like "sparse covariance regularization autoencoder interpretability" or "top-k correlation regularization autoencoder" might yield better results. If no relevant papers come up, then the idea might indeed be novel. 

But wait, the user's approach is quite specific: dynamically selecting the top-k correlated pairs per batch and adjusting k over time. I haven't seen any of the previous papers mention that. The closest might be some work on structured sparsity or group lasso, but that's different. The dynamic aspect of k adjustment based on training time (with the exponential decay schedule) also seems unique. 

Given that the previous queries didn't find overlapping work and the specific technical details of the proposed method, it's likely that this approach hasn't been explored yet. However, to be thorough, maybe one last query with different keywords would help. If that still doesn't find anything, then the decision can be made confidently.

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine. The experimental results show that the proposed KT-SAE method has improved transfer accuracy compared to other related transfer learning methods.\n\n1: Estimation of sparse covariance matrix via non-convex regularization.

However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine. The experimental results show that the proposed KT-SAE method has improved transfer accuracy compared to other related transfer learning methods.\n\n1: Estimation of sparse covariance matrix via non-convex regularization.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Ni\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2108631516\', \'name\': \'Li-Xin Wang\'}]. Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779.

IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 2020.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: In sparse DOA estimation methods, the regularization parameter λ is generally empirically tuned. In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine. The experimental results show that the proposed KT-SAE method has improved transfer accuracy compared to other related transfer learning methods.\n\n1: Estimation of sparse covariance matrix via non-convex regularization.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 2020.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: In sparse DOA estimation methods, the regularization parameter λ is generally empirically tuned. In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

Frontiers of Chinese Pure Mathematics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Linear discriminant analysis plays an important role in feature extraction, data dimensionality reduction, and classification. With the progress of science and technology, the data that need to be processed are becoming increasingly large. However, in high-dimensional situations, linear discriminant analysis faces two problems: the lack of interpretability of the projected data since they all involve all p features, which are linear combinations of all features, as well as the singularity problem of the within-class covariance matrix. There are three different arguments for linear discriminant analysis: multivariate Gaussian model, Fisher discrimination problem, and optimal scoring problem. To solve these two problems, this article establishes a model for solving the kth discriminant component, which first transforms the original model of Fisher discriminant problem in linear discriminant analysis by using a diagonal estimated matrix for the within-class variance in place of the original within-class covariance matrix, which overcomes the singularity problem of the matrix and projects it to an orthogonal projection space to remove its orthogonal constraints, and subsequently an lq norm regularization term is added to enhance its interpretability for the purpose of dimensionality reduction and classification. Finally, an iterative algorithm for solving the model and a convergence analysis are given, and it is proved that the sequence generated by the algorithm is descended and converges to a local minimum of the problem for any initial value.\n\n1: An enhanced sparse autoencoder for machinery interpretable fault diagnosis.

This paper aims to address this gap by delving into the interpretability of the encoding and decoding structures and their correlation with the physical significance of vibrational signals. To achieve this, the Sparse Coding with Multi-layer Decoders (SC-MD) model is proposed, which facilitates fault diagnosis from two perspectives: the working principles of the model itself and the evolving trends of fault features. Specifically, a sparse coding protocol to prevent L1-norm collapse is proposed in the encoding process, regularizing the encoding to ensure that each latent code component possesses variance greater than a fixed threshold on a set of sparse representations given the input data. Subsequently, a multi-layer decoder structure is designed to capture the intricate mapping relationship between features and fault patterns. Finally, the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) is employed as the solver for the SC-MD model, enabling end-to-end updates of all parameters by unfolding FISTA. The coherent theoretical framework ensures the interpretability of SC-MD. Utilizing aeroengine bearing data, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed approach under both normal conditions and intense noise, as compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.\n\n2: Enhancing Neural Network Interpretability with Feature-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders.

By training on synthetic data with known features of the input, we show that \\textsc{MFR} can help SAEs learn those features, as we can directly compare the features learned by the SAE with the input features for the synthetic data. We then scale \\textsc{MFR} to SAEs that are trained to denoise electroencephalography (EEG) data and SAEs that are trained to reconstruct GPT-2 Small activations. We show that \\textsc{MFR} can improve the reconstruction loss of SAEs by up to 21.21\\% on GPT-2 Small, and 6.67\\% on EEG data. Our results suggest that the similarity between features learned by different SAEs can be leveraged to improve SAE training, thereby enhancing performance and the usefulness of SAEs for model interpretability.\n\n3: SPARSE REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF DATA BY AUTOENCODERS WITH L 1 / 2 REGULARIZATION.

Sparse representation can improve the interpretability of the input data and the generalization of a model by eliminating redundant features and extracting the latent structure of data. In this paper, we use L1/2 regularization method to enforce sparsity on the hidden representation of an autoencoder for achieving sparse representation of data. The performance of our approach in terms of unsupervised feature learning and supervised classification is assessed on the MNIST digit data set, the ORL face database and the Reuters-21578 text corpus. The results demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder can produce sparser representation and better reconstruction performance than the Sparse Autoencoder and the L1 regularization Autoencoder. The new representation is also illustrated to be useful for a deep network to improve the classification performance.\n\n4: Disentangled representation learning with physics-informed variational autoencoder for structural health monitoring.

Labor intensive manual inspection and assessment on a large scale is often infeasible, while data-driven machine learning techniques can fail to identify relevant failure mechanisms and suffer from poor generalization to previously unseen conditions, particularly when data is sparse. We propose a multi-task learning approach based on a physics-informed variational autoencoder that leverages a dictionary of physics-based models to improve the predictive performance when limited data is available. The latent space of the autoencoder is augmented with a set of physics-based latent variables that are interpretable and allow for prior knowledge on the latent variables to be included in the autoencoder formulation. To prevent the data-driven components of the encoder and decoder from overriding the known physics, a regularization method is used to impose physical constraints on the latent space and the generative model prediction. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study of quay walls in Amsterdam, demonstrating improved performance over purely data-driven methods. \n\n\n5: Unmixing Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction from Hyperspectral Data..

Analytical Chemistry, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Due to the complexity of samples and the limitations in spatial resolution, the spectra in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are generally contributed to by multiple components, making univariate analysis ineffective. Although feature extraction methods have been applied, the chemical meaning of the compressed variables is difficult to interpret, limiting their further applications. An unmixing autoencoder (UAE) was developed in this work for the separation of the mixed spectra in HSI. The proposed model is composed of an encoder and a fully connected (FC) layer. The former is used to compress the input spectrum into several variables, and the latter is employed to reconstruct the spectrum. Combining reconstruction loss and sparse regularization, the weights and the spectral profiles of the components will be encoded in the compressed variables and the connection weights of FC, respectively. A simulated and three experimental HSI data sets were adopted to investigate the performance of the UAE model. The spectral components were successfully obtained, from which the handwriting under papers was revealed from the image of near-infrared (NIR) diffusive reflectance spectroscopy, and the images of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids were reconstructed from the Raman and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) images.\n\n6: Sparse deep encoded features with enhanced sinogramic red deer optimization for fault inspection in wafer maps.

Stat, 2017.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: For high‐dimensional data, the standard empirical estimator for the covariance matrix is very poor, and thus many methods have been proposed to more accurately estimate the covariance structure of high‐dimensional data. In this article, we consider estimation under the assumption of sparsity but regularize with respect to the individual false‐positive rate for incorrectly including a matrix entry in the support of the final estimator. The two benefits of this approach are (1) an interpretable regularization parameter removing the need for computationally expensive tuning and (2) extremely fast computation time arising from use of a binary search algorithm implemented to find the best estimator within a carefully constructed operator norm ball. We compare our approach to universal thresholding estimators and lasso‐style penalized estimators on both simulated data and data from gene expression for cancerous tumours.\n\n8: Sparse Coding with Multi-Layer Decoders using Variance Regularization. [{\'authorId\': \'13188440\', \'name\': \'Katrina Evtimova\'}, {\'authorId\': \'1688882\', \'name\': \'Yann LeCun\'}]. Trans. Mach. Learn. Res., 2021.\nNumber of citations: 9\nAbstract: Sparse representations of images are useful in many computer vision applications. Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear dictionary requires regularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in the $l_1$ norms of the codes. Typically, this regularization entails bounding the Euclidean norms of the dictionary\'s elements. In this work, we propose a novel sparse coding protocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the need to regularize the decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so that each latent code component has variance greater than a fixed threshold over a set of sparse representations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we explore ways to effectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer decoders since they can model more complex relationships than linear dictionaries. In our experiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show that decoders learned with our approach have interpretable features both in the linear and multi-layer case. Moreover, we show that sparse autoencoders with multi-layer decoders trained using our variance regularization method produce higher quality reconstructions with sparser representations when compared to autoencoders with linear dictionaries. Additionally, sparse representations obtained with our variance regularization approach are useful in the downstream tasks of denoising and classification in the low-data regime.\n\n9: Non-linear, Sparse Dimensionality Reduction via Path Lasso Penalized Autoencoders. [{\'authorId\': \'4013089\', \'name\': \'Oskar Allerbo\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2088825\', \'name\': \'Rebecka Jörnsten\'}]. Journal of machine learning research, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: High-dimensional data sets are often analyzed and explored via the construction of a latent low-dimensional space which enables convenient visualization and efficient predictive modeling or clustering. For complex data structures, linear dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA may not be sufficiently flexible to enable low-dimensional representation. Non-linear dimension reduction techniques, like kernel PCA and autoencoders, suffer from loss of interpretability since each latent variable is dependent of all input dimensions. To address this limitation, we here present path lasso penalized autoencoders. This structured regularization enhances interpretability by penalizing each path through the encoder from an input to a latent variable, thus restricting how many input variables are represented in each latent dimension. Our algorithm uses a group lasso penalty and non-negative matrix factorization to construct a sparse, non-linear latent representation. We compare the path lasso regularized autoencoder to PCA, sparse PCA, autoencoders and sparse autoencoders on real and simulated data sets. We show that the algorithm exhibits much lower reconstruction errors than sparse PCA and parameter-wise lasso regularized autoencoders for low-dimensional representations. Moreover, path lasso representations provide a more accurate reconstruction match, i.e. preserved relative distance between objects in the original and reconstructed spaces.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

reasoning_content is Okay, let's see. The user's idea is about using a sparse top-k covariance regularization in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to improve interpretability of latent features. They want to apply this specifically to address issues like polysemanticity and feature absorption in SAEs, using dynamic k-selection for the most correlated pairs. 

Looking at the papers returned from the latest query, I need to check if any of them already propose a similar approach. Let me go through each one:

1. **"An enhanced sparse autoencoder for machinery interpretable fault diagnosis"** introduces a sparse coding protocol to prevent L1-norm collapse and uses a multi-layer decoder. They mention regularization but it's focused on variance thresholds for latent codes, not covariance between features. Their approach is different because they're dealing with fault diagnosis, not feature disentanglement via covariance.

2. **"Enhancing Neural Network Interpretability with Feature-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders"** uses mutual feature regularization (MFR) to align features across multiple SAEs. This is about training SAEs in parallel to learn similar features, not about covariance regularization. The focus is on improving reconstruction and feature alignment, not decorrelating features.

3. **"SPARSE REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF DATA BY AUTOENCODERS WITH L 1 / 2 REGULARIZATION"** uses L1/2 regularization for sparsity. This is a different type of regularization, not involving covariance between latent features. They focus on sparsity in the hidden layer, not pairwise correlations.

4. **"Disentangled representation learning with physics-informed variational autoencoder..."** incorporates physics-based latent variables with regularization. The regularization here is physics-informed, not covariance-based. It's a different context (structural health monitoring) and method.

5. **"Sparse Coding with Multi-Layer Decoders using Variance Regularization"** introduces variance regularization to prevent collapse in sparse codes. They regularize the variance of each latent component, not their pairwise covariances. The approach is different as they don't target feature correlations.

The other papers either focus on different applications (like hyperspectral data, wafer maps) or different regularization methods (like path lasso, group lasso). None of the papers mention using top-k covariance regularization with dynamic selection to decorrelate the most correlated features in SAEs. The core idea of selecting the top-k correlated pairs per batch and dynamically adjusting k seems novel in the context of SAEs for interpretability. 

Therefore, the idea hasn't been addressed in the existing literature found so far. The user's approach combines dynamic sparsity in covariance regularization specifically for SAEs, which isn't covered by the retrieved papers. Decision made: novel.

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

[{\'authorId\': \'2267557643\', \'name\': \'Chen Jing\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2267714756\', \'name\': \'Caixia Gao\'}]. Frontiers of Chinese Pure Mathematics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Linear discriminant analysis plays an important role in feature extraction, data dimensionality reduction, and classification. With the progress of science and technology, the data that need to be processed are becoming increasingly large. However, in high-dimensional situations, linear discriminant analysis faces two problems: the lack of interpretability of the projected data since they all involve all p features, which are linear combinations of all features, as well as the singularity problem of the within-class covariance matrix. There are three different arguments for linear discriminant analysis: multivariate Gaussian model, Fisher discrimination problem, and optimal scoring problem. To solve these two problems, this article establishes a model for solving the kth discriminant component, which first transforms the original model of Fisher discriminant problem in linear discriminant analysis by using a diagonal estimated matrix for the within-class variance in place of the original within-class covariance matrix, which overcomes the singularity problem of the matrix and projects it to an orthogonal projection space to remove its orthogonal constraints, and subsequently an lq norm regularization term is added to enhance its interpretability for the purpose of dimensionality reduction and classification. Finally, an iterative algorithm for solving the model and a convergence analysis are given, and it is proved that the sequence generated by the algorithm is descended and converges to a local minimum of the problem for any initial value.\n\n1: An enhanced sparse autoencoder for machinery interpretable fault diagnosis.

This paper aims to address this gap by delving into the interpretability of the encoding and decoding structures and their correlation with the physical significance of vibrational signals. To achieve this, the Sparse Coding with Multi-layer Decoders (SC-MD) model is proposed, which facilitates fault diagnosis from two perspectives: the working principles of the model itself and the evolving trends of fault features. Specifically, a sparse coding protocol to prevent L1-norm collapse is proposed in the encoding process, regularizing the encoding to ensure that each latent code component possesses variance greater than a fixed threshold on a set of sparse representations given the input data. Subsequently, a multi-layer decoder structure is designed to capture the intricate mapping relationship between features and fault patterns. Finally, the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) is employed as the solver for the SC-MD model, enabling end-to-end updates of all parameters by unfolding FISTA. The coherent theoretical framework ensures the interpretability of SC-MD. Utilizing aeroengine bearing data, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed approach under both normal conditions and intense noise, as compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.\n\n2: Enhancing Neural Network Interpretability with Feature-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders.

We propose \\textsc{Mutual Feature Regularization} \\textbf{(MFR)}, a regularization technique for improving feature learning by encouraging SAEs trained in parallel to learn similar features. We motivate \\textsc{MFR} by showing that features learned by multiple SAEs are more likely to correlate with features of the input. By training on synthetic data with known features of the input, we show that \\textsc{MFR} can help SAEs learn those features, as we can directly compare the features learned by the SAE with the input features for the synthetic data. We then scale \\textsc{MFR} to SAEs that are trained to denoise electroencephalography (EEG) data and SAEs that are trained to reconstruct GPT-2 Small activations. We show that \\textsc{MFR} can improve the reconstruction loss of SAEs by up to 21.21\\% on GPT-2 Small, and 6.67\\% on EEG data. Our results suggest that the similarity between features learned by different SAEs can be leveraged to improve SAE training, thereby enhancing performance and the usefulness of SAEs for model interpretability.\n\n3: SPARSE REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF DATA BY AUTOENCODERS WITH L 1 / 2 REGULARIZATION.

Sparse representation can improve the interpretability of the input data and the generalization of a model by eliminating redundant features and extracting the latent structure of data. In this paper, we use L1/2 regularization method to enforce sparsity on the hidden representation of an autoencoder for achieving sparse representation of data. The performance of our approach in terms of unsupervised feature learning and supervised classification is assessed on the MNIST digit data set, the ORL face database and the Reuters-21578 text corpus. The results demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder can produce sparser representation and better reconstruction performance than the Sparse Autoencoder and the L1 regularization Autoencoder. The new representation is also illustrated to be useful for a deep network to improve the classification performance.\n\n4: Disentangled representation learning with physics-informed variational autoencoder for structural health monitoring.

Labor intensive manual inspection and assessment on a large scale is often infeasible, while data-driven machine learning techniques can fail to identify relevant failure mechanisms and suffer from poor generalization to previously unseen conditions, particularly when data is sparse. We propose a multi-task learning approach based on a physics-informed variational autoencoder that leverages a dictionary of physics-based models to improve the predictive performance when limited data is available. The latent space of the autoencoder is augmented with a set of physics-based latent variables that are interpretable and allow for prior knowledge on the latent variables to be included in the autoencoder formulation. To prevent the data-driven components of the encoder and decoder from overriding the known physics, a regularization method is used to impose physical constraints on the latent space and the generative model prediction. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study of quay walls in Amsterdam, demonstrating improved performance over purely data-driven methods. \n\n\n5: Unmixing Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction from Hyperspectral Data..

Analytical Chemistry, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Due to the complexity of samples and the limitations in spatial resolution, the spectra in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are generally contributed to by multiple components, making univariate analysis ineffective. Although feature extraction methods have been applied, the chemical meaning of the compressed variables is difficult to interpret, limiting their further applications. An unmixing autoencoder (UAE) was developed in this work for the separation of the mixed spectra in HSI. The proposed model is composed of an encoder and a fully connected (FC) layer. The former is used to compress the input spectrum into several variables, and the latter is employed to reconstruct the spectrum. Combining reconstruction loss and sparse regularization, the weights and the spectral profiles of the components will be encoded in the compressed variables and the connection weights of FC, respectively. A simulated and three experimental HSI data sets were adopted to investigate the performance of the UAE model. The spectral components were successfully obtained, from which the handwriting under papers was revealed from the image of near-infrared (NIR) diffusive reflectance spectroscopy, and the images of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids were reconstructed from the Raman and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) images.\n\n6: Sparse deep encoded features with enhanced sinogramic red deer optimization for fault inspection in wafer maps.

Stat, 2017.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: For high‐dimensional data, the standard empirical estimator for the covariance matrix is very poor, and thus many methods have been proposed to more accurately estimate the covariance structure of high‐dimensional data. In this article, we consider estimation under the assumption of sparsity but regularize with respect to the individual false‐positive rate for incorrectly including a matrix entry in the support of the final estimator. The two benefits of this approach are (1) an interpretable regularization parameter removing the need for computationally expensive tuning and (2) extremely fast computation time arising from use of a binary search algorithm implemented to find the best estimator within a carefully constructed operator norm ball. We compare our approach to universal thresholding estimators and lasso‐style penalized estimators on both simulated data and data from gene expression for cancerous tumours.\n\n8: Sparse Coding with Multi-Layer Decoders using Variance Regularization. [{\'authorId\': \'13188440\', \'name\': \'Katrina Evtimova\'}, {\'authorId\': \'1688882\', \'name\': \'Yann LeCun\'}]. Trans. Mach. Learn. Res., 2021.\nNumber of citations: 9\nAbstract: Sparse representations of images are useful in many computer vision applications. Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear dictionary requires regularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in the $l_1$ norms of the codes. Typically, this regularization entails bounding the Euclidean norms of the dictionary\'s elements. In this work, we propose a novel sparse coding protocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the need to regularize the decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so that each latent code component has variance greater than a fixed threshold over a set of sparse representations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we explore ways to effectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer decoders since they can model more complex relationships than linear dictionaries. In our experiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show that decoders learned with our approach have interpretable features both in the linear and multi-layer case. Moreover, we show that sparse autoencoders with multi-layer decoders trained using our variance regularization method produce higher quality reconstructions with sparser representations when compared to autoencoders with linear dictionaries. Additionally, sparse representations obtained with our variance regularization approach are useful in the downstream tasks of denoising and classification in the low-data regime.\n\n9: Non-linear, Sparse Dimensionality Reduction via Path Lasso Penalized Autoencoders. [{\'authorId\': \'4013089\', \'name\': \'Oskar Allerbo\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2088825\', \'name\': \'Rebecka Jörnsten\'}]. Journal of machine learning research, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: High-dimensional data sets are often analyzed and explored via the construction of a latent low-dimensional space which enables convenient visualization and efficient predictive modeling or clustering. For complex data structures, linear dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA may not be sufficiently flexible to enable low-dimensional representation. Non-linear dimension reduction techniques, like kernel PCA and autoencoders, suffer from loss of interpretability since each latent variable is dependent of all input dimensions. To address this limitation, we here present path lasso penalized autoencoders. This structured regularization enhances interpretability by penalizing each path through the encoder from an input to a latent variable, thus restricting how many input variables are represented in each latent dimension. Our algorithm uses a group lasso penalty and non-negative matrix factorization to construct a sparse, non-linear latent representation. We compare the path lasso regularized autoencoder to PCA, sparse PCA, autoencoders and sparse autoencoders on real and simulated data sets. We show that the algorithm exhibits much lower reconstruction errors than sparse PCA and parameter-wise lasso regularized autoencoders for low-dimensional representations. Moreover, path lasso representations provide a more accurate reconstruction match, i.e. preserved relative distance between objects in the original and reconstructed spaces.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine. The experimental results show that the proposed KT-SAE method has improved transfer accuracy compared to other related transfer learning methods.\n\n1: Estimation of sparse covariance matrix via non-convex regularization.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

[{\'authorId\': \'2267557643\', \'name\': \'Chen Jing\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2267714756\', \'name\': \'Caixia Gao\'}]. Frontiers of Chinese Pure Mathematics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Linear discriminant analysis plays an important role in feature extraction, data dimensionality reduction, and classification. With the progress of science and technology, the data that need to be processed are becoming increasingly large. However, in high-dimensional situations, linear discriminant analysis faces two problems: the lack of interpretability of the projected data since they all involve all p features, which are linear combinations of all features, as well as the singularity problem of the within-class covariance matrix. There are three different arguments for linear discriminant analysis: multivariate Gaussian model, Fisher discrimination problem, and optimal scoring problem. To solve these two problems, this article establishes a model for solving the kth discriminant component, which first transforms the original model of Fisher discriminant problem in linear discriminant analysis by using a diagonal estimated matrix for the within-class variance in place of the original within-class covariance matrix, which overcomes the singularity problem of the matrix and projects it to an orthogonal projection space to remove its orthogonal constraints, and subsequently an lq norm regularization term is added to enhance its interpretability for the purpose of dimensionality reduction and classification. Finally, an iterative algorithm for solving the model and a convergence analysis are given, and it is proved that the sequence generated by the algorithm is descended and converges to a local minimum of the problem for any initial value.\n\n1: An enhanced sparse autoencoder for machinery interpretable fault diagnosis.

This paper aims to address this gap by delving into the interpretability of the encoding and decoding structures and their correlation with the physical significance of vibrational signals. To achieve this, the Sparse Coding with Multi-layer Decoders (SC-MD) model is proposed, which facilitates fault diagnosis from two perspectives: the working principles of the model itself and the evolving trends of fault features. Specifically, a sparse coding protocol to prevent L1-norm collapse is proposed in the encoding process, regularizing the encoding to ensure that each latent code component possesses variance greater than a fixed threshold on a set of sparse representations given the input data. Subsequently, a multi-layer decoder structure is designed to capture the intricate mapping relationship between features and fault patterns. Finally, the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) is employed as the solver for the SC-MD model, enabling end-to-end updates of all parameters by unfolding FISTA. The coherent theoretical framework ensures the interpretability of SC-MD. Utilizing aeroengine bearing data, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed approach under both normal conditions and intense noise, as compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.\n\n2: Enhancing Neural Network Interpretability with Feature-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders.

We propose \\textsc{Mutual Feature Regularization} \\textbf{(MFR)}, a regularization technique for improving feature learning by encouraging SAEs trained in parallel to learn similar features. We motivate \\textsc{MFR} by showing that features learned by multiple SAEs are more likely to correlate with features of the input. By training on synthetic data with known features of the input, we show that \\textsc{MFR} can help SAEs learn those features, as we can directly compare the features learned by the SAE with the input features for the synthetic data. We then scale \\textsc{MFR} to SAEs that are trained to denoise electroencephalography (EEG) data and SAEs that are trained to reconstruct GPT-2 Small activations. We show that \\textsc{MFR} can improve the reconstruction loss of SAEs by up to 21.21\\% on GPT-2 Small, and 6.67\\% on EEG data. Our results suggest that the similarity between features learned by different SAEs can be leveraged to improve SAE training, thereby enhancing performance and the usefulness of SAEs for model interpretability.\n\n3: SPARSE REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF DATA BY AUTOENCODERS WITH L 1 / 2 REGULARIZATION.

Sparse representation can improve the interpretability of the input data and the generalization of a model by eliminating redundant features and extracting the latent structure of data. In this paper, we use L1/2 regularization method to enforce sparsity on the hidden representation of an autoencoder for achieving sparse representation of data. The performance of our approach in terms of unsupervised feature learning and supervised classification is assessed on the MNIST digit data set, the ORL face database and the Reuters-21578 text corpus. The results demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder can produce sparser representation and better reconstruction performance than the Sparse Autoencoder and the L1 regularization Autoencoder. The new representation is also illustrated to be useful for a deep network to improve the classification performance.\n\n4: Disentangled representation learning with physics-informed variational autoencoder for structural health monitoring.

Labor intensive manual inspection and assessment on a large scale is often infeasible, while data-driven machine learning techniques can fail to identify relevant failure mechanisms and suffer from poor generalization to previously unseen conditions, particularly when data is sparse. We propose a multi-task learning approach based on a physics-informed variational autoencoder that leverages a dictionary of physics-based models to improve the predictive performance when limited data is available. The latent space of the autoencoder is augmented with a set of physics-based latent variables that are interpretable and allow for prior knowledge on the latent variables to be included in the autoencoder formulation. To prevent the data-driven components of the encoder and decoder from overriding the known physics, a regularization method is used to impose physical constraints on the latent space and the generative model prediction. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study of quay walls in Amsterdam, demonstrating improved performance over purely data-driven methods. \n\n\n5: Unmixing Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction from Hyperspectral Data..

Analytical Chemistry, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Due to the complexity of samples and the limitations in spatial resolution, the spectra in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are generally contributed to by multiple components, making univariate analysis ineffective. Although feature extraction methods have been applied, the chemical meaning of the compressed variables is difficult to interpret, limiting their further applications. An unmixing autoencoder (UAE) was developed in this work for the separation of the mixed spectra in HSI. The proposed model is composed of an encoder and a fully connected (FC) layer. The former is used to compress the input spectrum into several variables, and the latter is employed to reconstruct the spectrum. Combining reconstruction loss and sparse regularization, the weights and the spectral profiles of the components will be encoded in the compressed variables and the connection weights of FC, respectively. A simulated and three experimental HSI data sets were adopted to investigate the performance of the UAE model. The spectral components were successfully obtained, from which the handwriting under papers was revealed from the image of near-infrared (NIR) diffusive reflectance spectroscopy, and the images of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids were reconstructed from the Raman and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) images.\n\n6: Sparse deep encoded features with enhanced sinogramic red deer optimization for fault inspection in wafer maps.

Stat, 2017.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: For high‐dimensional data, the standard empirical estimator for the covariance matrix is very poor, and thus many methods have been proposed to more accurately estimate the covariance structure of high‐dimensional data. In this article, we consider estimation under the assumption of sparsity but regularize with respect to the individual false‐positive rate for incorrectly including a matrix entry in the support of the final estimator. The two benefits of this approach are (1) an interpretable regularization parameter removing the need for computationally expensive tuning and (2) extremely fast computation time arising from use of a binary search algorithm implemented to find the best estimator within a carefully constructed operator norm ball. We compare our approach to universal thresholding estimators and lasso‐style penalized estimators on both simulated data and data from gene expression for cancerous tumours.\n\n8: Sparse Coding with Multi-Layer Decoders using Variance Regularization.

Res., 2021.\nNumber of citations: 9\nAbstract: Sparse representations of images are useful in many computer vision applications. Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear dictionary requires regularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in the $l_1$ norms of the codes. Typically, this regularization entails bounding the Euclidean norms of the dictionary\'s elements. In this work, we propose a novel sparse coding protocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the need to regularize the decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so that each latent code component has variance greater than a fixed threshold over a set of sparse representations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we explore ways to effectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer decoders since they can model more complex relationships than linear dictionaries. In our experiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show that decoders learned with our approach have interpretable features both in the linear and multi-layer case. Moreover, we show that sparse autoencoders with multi-layer decoders trained using our variance regularization method produce higher quality reconstructions with sparser representations when compared to autoencoders with linear dictionaries. Additionally, sparse representations obtained with our variance regularization approach are useful in the downstream tasks of denoising and classification in the low-data regime.\n\n9: Non-linear, Sparse Dimensionality Reduction via Path Lasso Penalized Autoencoders.

Journal of machine learning research, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: High-dimensional data sets are often analyzed and explored via the construction of a latent low-dimensional space which enables convenient visualization and efficient predictive modeling or clustering. For complex data structures, linear dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA may not be sufficiently flexible to enable low-dimensional representation. Non-linear dimension reduction techniques, like kernel PCA and autoencoders, suffer from loss of interpretability since each latent variable is dependent of all input dimensions. To address this limitation, we here present path lasso penalized autoencoders. This structured regularization enhances interpretability by penalizing each path through the encoder from an input to a latent variable, thus restricting how many input variables are represented in each latent dimension. Our algorithm uses a group lasso penalty and non-negative matrix factorization to construct a sparse, non-linear latent representation. We compare the path lasso regularized autoencoder to PCA, sparse PCA, autoencoders and sparse autoencoders on real and simulated data sets. We show that the algorithm exhibits much lower reconstruction errors than sparse PCA and parameter-wise lasso regularized autoencoders for low-dimensional representations. Moreover, path lasso representations provide a more accurate reconstruction match, i.e. preserved relative distance between objects in the original and reconstructed spaces.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

Frontiers of Chinese Pure Mathematics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Linear discriminant analysis plays an important role in feature extraction, data dimensionality reduction, and classification. With the progress of science and technology, the data that need to be processed are becoming increasingly large. However, in high-dimensional situations, linear discriminant analysis faces two problems: the lack of interpretability of the projected data since they all involve all p features, which are linear combinations of all features, as well as the singularity problem of the within-class covariance matrix. There are three different arguments for linear discriminant analysis: multivariate Gaussian model, Fisher discrimination problem, and optimal scoring problem. To solve these two problems, this article establishes a model for solving the kth discriminant component, which first transforms the original model of Fisher discriminant problem in linear discriminant analysis by using a diagonal estimated matrix for the within-class variance in place of the original within-class covariance matrix, which overcomes the singularity problem of the matrix and projects it to an orthogonal projection space to remove its orthogonal constraints, and subsequently an lq norm regularization term is added to enhance its interpretability for the purpose of dimensionality reduction and classification. Finally, an iterative algorithm for solving the model and a convergence analysis are given, and it is proved that the sequence generated by the algorithm is descended and converges to a local minimum of the problem for any initial value.\n\n1: An enhanced sparse autoencoder for machinery interpretable fault diagnosis.

This paper aims to address this gap by delving into the interpretability of the encoding and decoding structures and their correlation with the physical significance of vibrational signals. To achieve this, the Sparse Coding with Multi-layer Decoders (SC-MD) model is proposed, which facilitates fault diagnosis from two perspectives: the working principles of the model itself and the evolving trends of fault features. Specifically, a sparse coding protocol to prevent L1-norm collapse is proposed in the encoding process, regularizing the encoding to ensure that each latent code component possesses variance greater than a fixed threshold on a set of sparse representations given the input data. Subsequently, a multi-layer decoder structure is designed to capture the intricate mapping relationship between features and fault patterns. Finally, the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) is employed as the solver for the SC-MD model, enabling end-to-end updates of all parameters by unfolding FISTA. The coherent theoretical framework ensures the interpretability of SC-MD. Utilizing aeroengine bearing data, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed approach under both normal conditions and intense noise, as compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.\n\n2: Enhancing Neural Network Interpretability with Feature-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders.

We motivate \\textsc{MFR} by showing that features learned by multiple SAEs are more likely to correlate with features of the input. By training on synthetic data with known features of the input, we show that \\textsc{MFR} can help SAEs learn those features, as we can directly compare the features learned by the SAE with the input features for the synthetic data. We then scale \\textsc{MFR} to SAEs that are trained to denoise electroencephalography (EEG) data and SAEs that are trained to reconstruct GPT-2 Small activations. We show that \\textsc{MFR} can improve the reconstruction loss of SAEs by up to 21.21\\% on GPT-2 Small, and 6.67\\% on EEG data. Our results suggest that the similarity between features learned by different SAEs can be leveraged to improve SAE training, thereby enhancing performance and the usefulness of SAEs for model interpretability.\n\n3: SPARSE REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF DATA BY AUTOENCODERS WITH L 1 / 2 REGULARIZATION.

Sparse representation can improve the interpretability of the input data and the generalization of a model by eliminating redundant features and extracting the latent structure of data. In this paper, we use L1/2 regularization method to enforce sparsity on the hidden representation of an autoencoder for achieving sparse representation of data. The performance of our approach in terms of unsupervised feature learning and supervised classification is assessed on the MNIST digit data set, the ORL face database and the Reuters-21578 text corpus. The results demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder can produce sparser representation and better reconstruction performance than the Sparse Autoencoder and the L1 regularization Autoencoder. The new representation is also illustrated to be useful for a deep network to improve the classification performance.\n\n4: Disentangled representation learning with physics-informed variational autoencoder for structural health monitoring.

Labor intensive manual inspection and assessment on a large scale is often infeasible, while data-driven machine learning techniques can fail to identify relevant failure mechanisms and suffer from poor generalization to previously unseen conditions, particularly when data is sparse. We propose a multi-task learning approach based on a physics-informed variational autoencoder that leverages a dictionary of physics-based models to improve the predictive performance when limited data is available. The latent space of the autoencoder is augmented with a set of physics-based latent variables that are interpretable and allow for prior knowledge on the latent variables to be included in the autoencoder formulation. To prevent the data-driven components of the encoder and decoder from overriding the known physics, a regularization method is used to impose physical constraints on the latent space and the generative model prediction. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study of quay walls in Amsterdam, demonstrating improved performance over purely data-driven methods. \n\n\n5: Unmixing Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction from Hyperspectral Data..

Analytical Chemistry, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Due to the complexity of samples and the limitations in spatial resolution, the spectra in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are generally contributed to by multiple components, making univariate analysis ineffective. Although feature extraction methods have been applied, the chemical meaning of the compressed variables is difficult to interpret, limiting their further applications. An unmixing autoencoder (UAE) was developed in this work for the separation of the mixed spectra in HSI. The proposed model is composed of an encoder and a fully connected (FC) layer. The former is used to compress the input spectrum into several variables, and the latter is employed to reconstruct the spectrum. Combining reconstruction loss and sparse regularization, the weights and the spectral profiles of the components will be encoded in the compressed variables and the connection weights of FC, respectively. A simulated and three experimental HSI data sets were adopted to investigate the performance of the UAE model. The spectral components were successfully obtained, from which the handwriting under papers was revealed from the image of near-infrared (NIR) diffusive reflectance spectroscopy, and the images of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids were reconstructed from the Raman and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) images.\n\n6: Sparse deep encoded features with enhanced sinogramic red deer optimization for fault inspection in wafer maps.

Stat, 2017.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: For high‐dimensional data, the standard empirical estimator for the covariance matrix is very poor, and thus many methods have been proposed to more accurately estimate the covariance structure of high‐dimensional data. In this article, we consider estimation under the assumption of sparsity but regularize with respect to the individual false‐positive rate for incorrectly including a matrix entry in the support of the final estimator. The two benefits of this approach are (1) an interpretable regularization parameter removing the need for computationally expensive tuning and (2) extremely fast computation time arising from use of a binary search algorithm implemented to find the best estimator within a carefully constructed operator norm ball. We compare our approach to universal thresholding estimators and lasso‐style penalized estimators on both simulated data and data from gene expression for cancerous tumours.\n\n8: Sparse Coding with Multi-Layer Decoders using Variance Regularization. [{\'authorId\': \'13188440\', \'name\': \'Katrina Evtimova\'}, {\'authorId\': \'1688882\', \'name\': \'Yann LeCun\'}]. Trans. Mach. Learn. Res., 2021.\nNumber of citations: 9\nAbstract: Sparse representations of images are useful in many computer vision applications. Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear dictionary requires regularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in the $l_1$ norms of the codes. Typically, this regularization entails bounding the Euclidean norms of the dictionary\'s elements. In this work, we propose a novel sparse coding protocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the need to regularize the decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so that each latent code component has variance greater than a fixed threshold over a set of sparse representations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we explore ways to effectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer decoders since they can model more complex relationships than linear dictionaries. In our experiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show that decoders learned with our approach have interpretable features both in the linear and multi-layer case. Moreover, we show that sparse autoencoders with multi-layer decoders trained using our variance regularization method produce higher quality reconstructions with sparser representations when compared to autoencoders with linear dictionaries. Additionally, sparse representations obtained with our variance regularization approach are useful in the downstream tasks of denoising and classification in the low-data regime.\n\n9: Non-linear, Sparse Dimensionality Reduction via Path Lasso Penalized Autoencoders. [{\'authorId\': \'4013089\', \'name\': \'Oskar Allerbo\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2088825\', \'name\': \'Rebecka Jörnsten\'}]. Journal of machine learning research, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: High-dimensional data sets are often analyzed and explored via the construction of a latent low-dimensional space which enables convenient visualization and efficient predictive modeling or clustering. For complex data structures, linear dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA may not be sufficiently flexible to enable low-dimensional representation. Non-linear dimension reduction techniques, like kernel PCA and autoencoders, suffer from loss of interpretability since each latent variable is dependent of all input dimensions. To address this limitation, we here present path lasso penalized autoencoders. This structured regularization enhances interpretability by penalizing each path through the encoder from an input to a latent variable, thus restricting how many input variables are represented in each latent dimension. Our algorithm uses a group lasso penalty and non-negative matrix factorization to construct a sparse, non-linear latent representation. We compare the path lasso regularized autoencoder to PCA, sparse PCA, autoencoders and sparse autoencoders on real and simulated data sets. We show that the algorithm exhibits much lower reconstruction errors than sparse PCA and parameter-wise lasso regularized autoencoders for low-dimensional representations. Moreover, path lasso representations provide a more accurate reconstruction match, i.e. preserved relative distance between objects in the original and reconstructed spaces.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

reasoning_content is Okay, let's go through this step by step. The user's idea is about using sparse covariance regularization in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to improve interpretability by targeting the most correlated feature pairs dynamically. They want to check if this is novel.

Looking at the previous search results, some papers use sparse regularization in autoencoders, like the L1/2 regularization for sparsity or variance regularization to prevent collapse. However, none specifically mention using top-k covariance regularization with dynamic k-selection. For example, paper 3 uses L1/2 regularization, and paper 8 uses variance regularization but not covariance. The key elements here are the covariance matrix focus, top-k selection of correlated pairs, and dynamic adjustment of k. 

The existing works either apply different regularization techniques (like L1, L1/2, variance) or use covariance in other contexts but not in the way proposed. The dynamic aspect of adjusting k over time also doesn't appear in the found papers. Since the core idea combines these specific elements for SAEs to address feature disentanglement, it seems novel. The previous queries didn't find overlapping methods. Decision made: novel.

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

Frontiers of Chinese Pure Mathematics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Linear discriminant analysis plays an important role in feature extraction, data dimensionality reduction, and classification. With the progress of science and technology, the data that need to be processed are becoming increasingly large. However, in high-dimensional situations, linear discriminant analysis faces two problems: the lack of interpretability of the projected data since they all involve all p features, which are linear combinations of all features, as well as the singularity problem of the within-class covariance matrix. There are three different arguments for linear discriminant analysis: multivariate Gaussian model, Fisher discrimination problem, and optimal scoring problem. To solve these two problems, this article establishes a model for solving the kth discriminant component, which first transforms the original model of Fisher discriminant problem in linear discriminant analysis by using a diagonal estimated matrix for the within-class variance in place of the original within-class covariance matrix, which overcomes the singularity problem of the matrix and projects it to an orthogonal projection space to remove its orthogonal constraints, and subsequently an lq norm regularization term is added to enhance its interpretability for the purpose of dimensionality reduction and classification. Finally, an iterative algorithm for solving the model and a convergence analysis are given, and it is proved that the sequence generated by the algorithm is descended and converges to a local minimum of the problem for any initial value.\n\n1: An enhanced sparse autoencoder for machinery interpretable fault diagnosis.

This paper aims to address this gap by delving into the interpretability of the encoding and decoding structures and their correlation with the physical significance of vibrational signals. To achieve this, the Sparse Coding with Multi-layer Decoders (SC-MD) model is proposed, which facilitates fault diagnosis from two perspectives: the working principles of the model itself and the evolving trends of fault features. Specifically, a sparse coding protocol to prevent L1-norm collapse is proposed in the encoding process, regularizing the encoding to ensure that each latent code component possesses variance greater than a fixed threshold on a set of sparse representations given the input data. Subsequently, a multi-layer decoder structure is designed to capture the intricate mapping relationship between features and fault patterns. Finally, the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) is employed as the solver for the SC-MD model, enabling end-to-end updates of all parameters by unfolding FISTA. The coherent theoretical framework ensures the interpretability of SC-MD. Utilizing aeroengine bearing data, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed approach under both normal conditions and intense noise, as compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.\n\n2: Enhancing Neural Network Interpretability with Feature-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders.

We propose \\textsc{Mutual Feature Regularization} \\textbf{(MFR)}, a regularization technique for improving feature learning by encouraging SAEs trained in parallel to learn similar features. We motivate \\textsc{MFR} by showing that features learned by multiple SAEs are more likely to correlate with features of the input. By training on synthetic data with known features of the input, we show that \\textsc{MFR} can help SAEs learn those features, as we can directly compare the features learned by the SAE with the input features for the synthetic data. We then scale \\textsc{MFR} to SAEs that are trained to denoise electroencephalography (EEG) data and SAEs that are trained to reconstruct GPT-2 Small activations. We show that \\textsc{MFR} can improve the reconstruction loss of SAEs by up to 21.21\\% on GPT-2 Small, and 6.67\\% on EEG data. Our results suggest that the similarity between features learned by different SAEs can be leveraged to improve SAE training, thereby enhancing performance and the usefulness of SAEs for model interpretability.\n\n3: SPARSE REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF DATA BY AUTOENCODERS WITH L 1 / 2 REGULARIZATION.

Sparse representation can improve the interpretability of the input data and the generalization of a model by eliminating redundant features and extracting the latent structure of data. In this paper, we use L1/2 regularization method to enforce sparsity on the hidden representation of an autoencoder for achieving sparse representation of data. The performance of our approach in terms of unsupervised feature learning and supervised classification is assessed on the MNIST digit data set, the ORL face database and the Reuters-21578 text corpus. The results demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder can produce sparser representation and better reconstruction performance than the Sparse Autoencoder and the L1 regularization Autoencoder. The new representation is also illustrated to be useful for a deep network to improve the classification performance.\n\n4: Disentangled representation learning with physics-informed variational autoencoder for structural health monitoring.

Labor intensive manual inspection and assessment on a large scale is often infeasible, while data-driven machine learning techniques can fail to identify relevant failure mechanisms and suffer from poor generalization to previously unseen conditions, particularly when data is sparse. We propose a multi-task learning approach based on a physics-informed variational autoencoder that leverages a dictionary of physics-based models to improve the predictive performance when limited data is available. The latent space of the autoencoder is augmented with a set of physics-based latent variables that are interpretable and allow for prior knowledge on the latent variables to be included in the autoencoder formulation. To prevent the data-driven components of the encoder and decoder from overriding the known physics, a regularization method is used to impose physical constraints on the latent space and the generative model prediction. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study of quay walls in Amsterdam, demonstrating improved performance over purely data-driven methods. \n\n\n5: Unmixing Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction from Hyperspectral Data..

Analytical Chemistry, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Due to the complexity of samples and the limitations in spatial resolution, the spectra in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are generally contributed to by multiple components, making univariate analysis ineffective. Although feature extraction methods have been applied, the chemical meaning of the compressed variables is difficult to interpret, limiting their further applications. An unmixing autoencoder (UAE) was developed in this work for the separation of the mixed spectra in HSI. The proposed model is composed of an encoder and a fully connected (FC) layer. The former is used to compress the input spectrum into several variables, and the latter is employed to reconstruct the spectrum. Combining reconstruction loss and sparse regularization, the weights and the spectral profiles of the components will be encoded in the compressed variables and the connection weights of FC, respectively. A simulated and three experimental HSI data sets were adopted to investigate the performance of the UAE model. The spectral components were successfully obtained, from which the handwriting under papers was revealed from the image of near-infrared (NIR) diffusive reflectance spectroscopy, and the images of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids were reconstructed from the Raman and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) images.\n\n6: Sparse deep encoded features with enhanced sinogramic red deer optimization for fault inspection in wafer maps.

Stat, 2017.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: For high‐dimensional data, the standard empirical estimator for the covariance matrix is very poor, and thus many methods have been proposed to more accurately estimate the covariance structure of high‐dimensional data. In this article, we consider estimation under the assumption of sparsity but regularize with respect to the individual false‐positive rate for incorrectly including a matrix entry in the support of the final estimator. The two benefits of this approach are (1) an interpretable regularization parameter removing the need for computationally expensive tuning and (2) extremely fast computation time arising from use of a binary search algorithm implemented to find the best estimator within a carefully constructed operator norm ball. We compare our approach to universal thresholding estimators and lasso‐style penalized estimators on both simulated data and data from gene expression for cancerous tumours.\n\n8: Sparse Coding with Multi-Layer Decoders using Variance Regularization. [{\'authorId\': \'13188440\', \'name\': \'Katrina Evtimova\'}, {\'authorId\': \'1688882\', \'name\': \'Yann LeCun\'}]. Trans. Mach. Learn. Res., 2021.\nNumber of citations: 9\nAbstract: Sparse representations of images are useful in many computer vision applications. Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear dictionary requires regularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in the $l_1$ norms of the codes. Typically, this regularization entails bounding the Euclidean norms of the dictionary\'s elements. In this work, we propose a novel sparse coding protocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the need to regularize the decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so that each latent code component has variance greater than a fixed threshold over a set of sparse representations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we explore ways to effectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer decoders since they can model more complex relationships than linear dictionaries. In our experiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show that decoders learned with our approach have interpretable features both in the linear and multi-layer case. Moreover, we show that sparse autoencoders with multi-layer decoders trained using our variance regularization method produce higher quality reconstructions with sparser representations when compared to autoencoders with linear dictionaries. Additionally, sparse representations obtained with our variance regularization approach are useful in the downstream tasks of denoising and classification in the low-data regime.\n\n9: Non-linear, Sparse Dimensionality Reduction via Path Lasso Penalized Autoencoders. [{\'authorId\': \'4013089\', \'name\': \'Oskar Allerbo\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2088825\', \'name\': \'Rebecka Jörnsten\'}]. Journal of machine learning research, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: High-dimensional data sets are often analyzed and explored via the construction of a latent low-dimensional space which enables convenient visualization and efficient predictive modeling or clustering. For complex data structures, linear dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA may not be sufficiently flexible to enable low-dimensional representation. Non-linear dimension reduction techniques, like kernel PCA and autoencoders, suffer from loss of interpretability since each latent variable is dependent of all input dimensions. To address this limitation, we here present path lasso penalized autoencoders. This structured regularization enhances interpretability by penalizing each path through the encoder from an input to a latent variable, thus restricting how many input variables are represented in each latent dimension. Our algorithm uses a group lasso penalty and non-negative matrix factorization to construct a sparse, non-linear latent representation. We compare the path lasso regularized autoencoder to PCA, sparse PCA, autoencoders and sparse autoencoders on real and simulated data sets. We show that the algorithm exhibits much lower reconstruction errors than sparse PCA and parameter-wise lasso regularized autoencoders for low-dimensional representations. Moreover, path lasso representations provide a more accurate reconstruction match, i.e. preserved relative distance between objects in the original and reconstructed spaces.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

[{\'authorId\': \'2267557643\', \'name\': \'Chen Jing\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2267714756\', \'name\': \'Caixia Gao\'}]. Frontiers of Chinese Pure Mathematics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Linear discriminant analysis plays an important role in feature extraction, data dimensionality reduction, and classification. With the progress of science and technology, the data that need to be processed are becoming increasingly large. However, in high-dimensional situations, linear discriminant analysis faces two problems: the lack of interpretability of the projected data since they all involve all p features, which are linear combinations of all features, as well as the singularity problem of the within-class covariance matrix. There are three different arguments for linear discriminant analysis: multivariate Gaussian model, Fisher discrimination problem, and optimal scoring problem. To solve these two problems, this article establishes a model for solving the kth discriminant component, which first transforms the original model of Fisher discriminant problem in linear discriminant analysis by using a diagonal estimated matrix for the within-class variance in place of the original within-class covariance matrix, which overcomes the singularity problem of the matrix and projects it to an orthogonal projection space to remove its orthogonal constraints, and subsequently an lq norm regularization term is added to enhance its interpretability for the purpose of dimensionality reduction and classification. Finally, an iterative algorithm for solving the model and a convergence analysis are given, and it is proved that the sequence generated by the algorithm is descended and converges to a local minimum of the problem for any initial value.\n\n1: An enhanced sparse autoencoder for machinery interpretable fault diagnosis.

Measurement science and technology, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 3\nAbstract: The interpretability of individual components within existing autoencoders remains insufficiently explored. This paper aims to address this gap by delving into the interpretability of the encoding and decoding structures and their correlation with the physical significance of vibrational signals. To achieve this, the Sparse Coding with Multi-layer Decoders (SC-MD) model is proposed, which facilitates fault diagnosis from two perspectives: the working principles of the model itself and the evolving trends of fault features. Specifically, a sparse coding protocol to prevent L1-norm collapse is proposed in the encoding process, regularizing the encoding to ensure that each latent code component possesses variance greater than a fixed threshold on a set of sparse representations given the input data. Subsequently, a multi-layer decoder structure is designed to capture the intricate mapping relationship between features and fault patterns. Finally, the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) is employed as the solver for the SC-MD model, enabling end-to-end updates of all parameters by unfolding FISTA. The coherent theoretical framework ensures the interpretability of SC-MD. Utilizing aeroengine bearing data, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed approach under both normal conditions and intense noise, as compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.\n\n2: Enhancing Neural Network Interpretability with Feature-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders.

We propose \\textsc{Mutual Feature Regularization} \\textbf{(MFR)}, a regularization technique for improving feature learning by encouraging SAEs trained in parallel to learn similar features. We motivate \\textsc{MFR} by showing that features learned by multiple SAEs are more likely to correlate with features of the input. By training on synthetic data with known features of the input, we show that \\textsc{MFR} can help SAEs learn those features, as we can directly compare the features learned by the SAE with the input features for the synthetic data. We then scale \\textsc{MFR} to SAEs that are trained to denoise electroencephalography (EEG) data and SAEs that are trained to reconstruct GPT-2 Small activations. We show that \\textsc{MFR} can improve the reconstruction loss of SAEs by up to 21.21\\% on GPT-2 Small, and 6.67\\% on EEG data. Our results suggest that the similarity between features learned by different SAEs can be leveraged to improve SAE training, thereby enhancing performance and the usefulness of SAEs for model interpretability.\n\n3: SPARSE REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF DATA BY AUTOENCODERS WITH L 1 / 2 REGULARIZATION.

Sparse representation can improve the interpretability of the input data and the generalization of a model by eliminating redundant features and extracting the latent structure of data. In this paper, we use L1/2 regularization method to enforce sparsity on the hidden representation of an autoencoder for achieving sparse representation of data. The performance of our approach in terms of unsupervised feature learning and supervised classification is assessed on the MNIST digit data set, the ORL face database and the Reuters-21578 text corpus. The results demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder can produce sparser representation and better reconstruction performance than the Sparse Autoencoder and the L1 regularization Autoencoder. The new representation is also illustrated to be useful for a deep network to improve the classification performance.\n\n4: Disentangled representation learning with physics-informed variational autoencoder for structural health monitoring.

Labor intensive manual inspection and assessment on a large scale is often infeasible, while data-driven machine learning techniques can fail to identify relevant failure mechanisms and suffer from poor generalization to previously unseen conditions, particularly when data is sparse. We propose a multi-task learning approach based on a physics-informed variational autoencoder that leverages a dictionary of physics-based models to improve the predictive performance when limited data is available. The latent space of the autoencoder is augmented with a set of physics-based latent variables that are interpretable and allow for prior knowledge on the latent variables to be included in the autoencoder formulation. To prevent the data-driven components of the encoder and decoder from overriding the known physics, a regularization method is used to impose physical constraints on the latent space and the generative model prediction. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study of quay walls in Amsterdam, demonstrating improved performance over purely data-driven methods. \n\n\n5: Unmixing Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction from Hyperspectral Data..

Analytical Chemistry, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Due to the complexity of samples and the limitations in spatial resolution, the spectra in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are generally contributed to by multiple components, making univariate analysis ineffective. Although feature extraction methods have been applied, the chemical meaning of the compressed variables is difficult to interpret, limiting their further applications. An unmixing autoencoder (UAE) was developed in this work for the separation of the mixed spectra in HSI. The proposed model is composed of an encoder and a fully connected (FC) layer. The former is used to compress the input spectrum into several variables, and the latter is employed to reconstruct the spectrum. Combining reconstruction loss and sparse regularization, the weights and the spectral profiles of the components will be encoded in the compressed variables and the connection weights of FC, respectively. A simulated and three experimental HSI data sets were adopted to investigate the performance of the UAE model. The spectral components were successfully obtained, from which the handwriting under papers was revealed from the image of near-infrared (NIR) diffusive reflectance spectroscopy, and the images of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids were reconstructed from the Raman and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) images.\n\n6: Sparse deep encoded features with enhanced sinogramic red deer optimization for fault inspection in wafer maps.

Stat, 2017.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: For high‐dimensional data, the standard empirical estimator for the covariance matrix is very poor, and thus many methods have been proposed to more accurately estimate the covariance structure of high‐dimensional data. In this article, we consider estimation under the assumption of sparsity but regularize with respect to the individual false‐positive rate for incorrectly including a matrix entry in the support of the final estimator. The two benefits of this approach are (1) an interpretable regularization parameter removing the need for computationally expensive tuning and (2) extremely fast computation time arising from use of a binary search algorithm implemented to find the best estimator within a carefully constructed operator norm ball. We compare our approach to universal thresholding estimators and lasso‐style penalized estimators on both simulated data and data from gene expression for cancerous tumours.\n\n8: Sparse Coding with Multi-Layer Decoders using Variance Regularization. [{\'authorId\': \'13188440\', \'name\': \'Katrina Evtimova\'}, {\'authorId\': \'1688882\', \'name\': \'Yann LeCun\'}]. Trans. Mach. Learn. Res., 2021.\nNumber of citations: 9\nAbstract: Sparse representations of images are useful in many computer vision applications. Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear dictionary requires regularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in the $l_1$ norms of the codes. Typically, this regularization entails bounding the Euclidean norms of the dictionary\'s elements. In this work, we propose a novel sparse coding protocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the need to regularize the decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so that each latent code component has variance greater than a fixed threshold over a set of sparse representations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we explore ways to effectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer decoders since they can model more complex relationships than linear dictionaries. In our experiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show that decoders learned with our approach have interpretable features both in the linear and multi-layer case. Moreover, we show that sparse autoencoders with multi-layer decoders trained using our variance regularization method produce higher quality reconstructions with sparser representations when compared to autoencoders with linear dictionaries. Additionally, sparse representations obtained with our variance regularization approach are useful in the downstream tasks of denoising and classification in the low-data regime.\n\n9: Non-linear, Sparse Dimensionality Reduction via Path Lasso Penalized Autoencoders. [{\'authorId\': \'4013089\', \'name\': \'Oskar Allerbo\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2088825\', \'name\': \'Rebecka Jörnsten\'}]. Journal of machine learning research, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: High-dimensional data sets are often analyzed and explored via the construction of a latent low-dimensional space which enables convenient visualization and efficient predictive modeling or clustering. For complex data structures, linear dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA may not be sufficiently flexible to enable low-dimensional representation. Non-linear dimension reduction techniques, like kernel PCA and autoencoders, suffer from loss of interpretability since each latent variable is dependent of all input dimensions. To address this limitation, we here present path lasso penalized autoencoders. This structured regularization enhances interpretability by penalizing each path through the encoder from an input to a latent variable, thus restricting how many input variables are represented in each latent dimension. Our algorithm uses a group lasso penalty and non-negative matrix factorization to construct a sparse, non-linear latent representation. We compare the path lasso regularized autoencoder to PCA, sparse PCA, autoencoders and sparse autoencoders on real and simulated data sets. We show that the algorithm exhibits much lower reconstruction errors than sparse PCA and parameter-wise lasso regularized autoencoders for low-dimensional representations. Moreover, path lasso representations provide a more accurate reconstruction match, i.e. preserved relative distance between objects in the original and reconstructed spaces.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine. The experimental results show that the proposed KT-SAE method has improved transfer accuracy compared to other related transfer learning methods.\n\n1: Estimation of sparse covariance matrix via non-convex regularization.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 2020.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: In sparse DOA estimation methods, the regularization parameter λ is generally empirically tuned. In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

Frontiers of Chinese Pure Mathematics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Linear discriminant analysis plays an important role in feature extraction, data dimensionality reduction, and classification. With the progress of science and technology, the data that need to be processed are becoming increasingly large. However, in high-dimensional situations, linear discriminant analysis faces two problems: the lack of interpretability of the projected data since they all involve all p features, which are linear combinations of all features, as well as the singularity problem of the within-class covariance matrix. There are three different arguments for linear discriminant analysis: multivariate Gaussian model, Fisher discrimination problem, and optimal scoring problem. To solve these two problems, this article establishes a model for solving the kth discriminant component, which first transforms the original model of Fisher discriminant problem in linear discriminant analysis by using a diagonal estimated matrix for the within-class variance in place of the original within-class covariance matrix, which overcomes the singularity problem of the matrix and projects it to an orthogonal projection space to remove its orthogonal constraints, and subsequently an lq norm regularization term is added to enhance its interpretability for the purpose of dimensionality reduction and classification. Finally, an iterative algorithm for solving the model and a convergence analysis are given, and it is proved that the sequence generated by the algorithm is descended and converges to a local minimum of the problem for any initial value.\n\n1: An enhanced sparse autoencoder for machinery interpretable fault diagnosis.

Measurement science and technology, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 3\nAbstract: The interpretability of individual components within existing autoencoders remains insufficiently explored. This paper aims to address this gap by delving into the interpretability of the encoding and decoding structures and their correlation with the physical significance of vibrational signals. To achieve this, the Sparse Coding with Multi-layer Decoders (SC-MD) model is proposed, which facilitates fault diagnosis from two perspectives: the working principles of the model itself and the evolving trends of fault features. Specifically, a sparse coding protocol to prevent L1-norm collapse is proposed in the encoding process, regularizing the encoding to ensure that each latent code component possesses variance greater than a fixed threshold on a set of sparse representations given the input data. Subsequently, a multi-layer decoder structure is designed to capture the intricate mapping relationship between features and fault patterns. Finally, the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) is employed as the solver for the SC-MD model, enabling end-to-end updates of all parameters by unfolding FISTA. The coherent theoretical framework ensures the interpretability of SC-MD. Utilizing aeroengine bearing data, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed approach under both normal conditions and intense noise, as compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.\n\n2: Enhancing Neural Network Interpretability with Feature-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders.

We propose \\textsc{Mutual Feature Regularization} \\textbf{(MFR)}, a regularization technique for improving feature learning by encouraging SAEs trained in parallel to learn similar features. We motivate \\textsc{MFR} by showing that features learned by multiple SAEs are more likely to correlate with features of the input. By training on synthetic data with known features of the input, we show that \\textsc{MFR} can help SAEs learn those features, as we can directly compare the features learned by the SAE with the input features for the synthetic data. We then scale \\textsc{MFR} to SAEs that are trained to denoise electroencephalography (EEG) data and SAEs that are trained to reconstruct GPT-2 Small activations. We show that \\textsc{MFR} can improve the reconstruction loss of SAEs by up to 21.21\\% on GPT-2 Small, and 6.67\\% on EEG data. Our results suggest that the similarity between features learned by different SAEs can be leveraged to improve SAE training, thereby enhancing performance and the usefulness of SAEs for model interpretability.\n\n3: SPARSE REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF DATA BY AUTOENCODERS WITH L 1 / 2 REGULARIZATION.

Sparse representation can improve the interpretability of the input data and the generalization of a model by eliminating redundant features and extracting the latent structure of data. In this paper, we use L1/2 regularization method to enforce sparsity on the hidden representation of an autoencoder for achieving sparse representation of data. The performance of our approach in terms of unsupervised feature learning and supervised classification is assessed on the MNIST digit data set, the ORL face database and the Reuters-21578 text corpus. The results demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder can produce sparser representation and better reconstruction performance than the Sparse Autoencoder and the L1 regularization Autoencoder. The new representation is also illustrated to be useful for a deep network to improve the classification performance.\n\n4: Disentangled representation learning with physics-informed variational autoencoder for structural health monitoring.

Labor intensive manual inspection and assessment on a large scale is often infeasible, while data-driven machine learning techniques can fail to identify relevant failure mechanisms and suffer from poor generalization to previously unseen conditions, particularly when data is sparse. We propose a multi-task learning approach based on a physics-informed variational autoencoder that leverages a dictionary of physics-based models to improve the predictive performance when limited data is available. The latent space of the autoencoder is augmented with a set of physics-based latent variables that are interpretable and allow for prior knowledge on the latent variables to be included in the autoencoder formulation. To prevent the data-driven components of the encoder and decoder from overriding the known physics, a regularization method is used to impose physical constraints on the latent space and the generative model prediction. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study of quay walls in Amsterdam, demonstrating improved performance over purely data-driven methods. \n\n\n5: Unmixing Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction from Hyperspectral Data..

Analytical Chemistry, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Due to the complexity of samples and the limitations in spatial resolution, the spectra in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are generally contributed to by multiple components, making univariate analysis ineffective. Although feature extraction methods have been applied, the chemical meaning of the compressed variables is difficult to interpret, limiting their further applications. An unmixing autoencoder (UAE) was developed in this work for the separation of the mixed spectra in HSI. The proposed model is composed of an encoder and a fully connected (FC) layer. The former is used to compress the input spectrum into several variables, and the latter is employed to reconstruct the spectrum. Combining reconstruction loss and sparse regularization, the weights and the spectral profiles of the components will be encoded in the compressed variables and the connection weights of FC, respectively. A simulated and three experimental HSI data sets were adopted to investigate the performance of the UAE model. The spectral components were successfully obtained, from which the handwriting under papers was revealed from the image of near-infrared (NIR) diffusive reflectance spectroscopy, and the images of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids were reconstructed from the Raman and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) images.\n\n6: Sparse deep encoded features with enhanced sinogramic red deer optimization for fault inspection in wafer maps.

Stat, 2017.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: For high‐dimensional data, the standard empirical estimator for the covariance matrix is very poor, and thus many methods have been proposed to more accurately estimate the covariance structure of high‐dimensional data. In this article, we consider estimation under the assumption of sparsity but regularize with respect to the individual false‐positive rate for incorrectly including a matrix entry in the support of the final estimator. The two benefits of this approach are (1) an interpretable regularization parameter removing the need for computationally expensive tuning and (2) extremely fast computation time arising from use of a binary search algorithm implemented to find the best estimator within a carefully constructed operator norm ball. We compare our approach to universal thresholding estimators and lasso‐style penalized estimators on both simulated data and data from gene expression for cancerous tumours.\n\n8: Sparse Coding with Multi-Layer Decoders using Variance Regularization.

Res., 2021.\nNumber of citations: 9\nAbstract: Sparse representations of images are useful in many computer vision applications. Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear dictionary requires regularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in the $l_1$ norms of the codes. Typically, this regularization entails bounding the Euclidean norms of the dictionary\'s elements. In this work, we propose a novel sparse coding protocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the need to regularize the decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so that each latent code component has variance greater than a fixed threshold over a set of sparse representations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we explore ways to effectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer decoders since they can model more complex relationships than linear dictionaries. In our experiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show that decoders learned with our approach have interpretable features both in the linear and multi-layer case. Moreover, we show that sparse autoencoders with multi-layer decoders trained using our variance regularization method produce higher quality reconstructions with sparser representations when compared to autoencoders with linear dictionaries. Additionally, sparse representations obtained with our variance regularization approach are useful in the downstream tasks of denoising and classification in the low-data regime.\n\n9: Non-linear, Sparse Dimensionality Reduction via Path Lasso Penalized Autoencoders.

Journal of machine learning research, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: High-dimensional data sets are often analyzed and explored via the construction of a latent low-dimensional space which enables convenient visualization and efficient predictive modeling or clustering. For complex data structures, linear dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA may not be sufficiently flexible to enable low-dimensional representation. Non-linear dimension reduction techniques, like kernel PCA and autoencoders, suffer from loss of interpretability since each latent variable is dependent of all input dimensions. To address this limitation, we here present path lasso penalized autoencoders. This structured regularization enhances interpretability by penalizing each path through the encoder from an input to a latent variable, thus restricting how many input variables are represented in each latent dimension. Our algorithm uses a group lasso penalty and non-negative matrix factorization to construct a sparse, non-linear latent representation. We compare the path lasso regularized autoencoder to PCA, sparse PCA, autoencoders and sparse autoencoders on real and simulated data sets. We show that the algorithm exhibits much lower reconstruction errors than sparse PCA and parameter-wise lasso regularized autoencoders for low-dimensional representations. Moreover, path lasso representations provide a more accurate reconstruction match, i.e. preserved relative distance between objects in the original and reconstructed spaces.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

reasoning_content is Alright, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is proposing a novel variant of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) that incorporates sparse top-k covariance regularization to improve interpretability of the latent features. The main idea is to regularize the covariance between latent features, but only target the top-k most correlated pairs each batch, dynamically adjusting k during training. The goal is to reduce polysemanticity and feature absorption, thereby enhancing metrics like SCR and TPP.

Looking at the previous rounds, several queries were made, and the returned papers didn't directly address this specific approach. The key components here are the use of covariance regularization in SAEs, dynamic k-selection, and targeting interpretability via SCR/TPP benchmarks. 

In Round 7, when searching for "sparse covariance regularization autoencoder interpretability", the papers found include methods like variance regularization (Katrina Evtimova and Yann LeCun's work), which focuses on preventing L1 norm collapse but doesn't address covariance between features. Another paper (Marks et al. 2024) introduces mutual feature regularization for SAEs to align features, which is different from covariance-based regularization. The others apply sparsity through L1/2 or other norms, not covariance.

The proposed method's novelty lies in combining covariance regularization with dynamic sparsity (top-k selection) specifically in the context of SAEs for interpretability. None of the found papers explicitly use a dynamic top-k selection of covariance pairs for regularization. Some papers discuss covariance estimation (like Kashlak and Kong 2017) but in different contexts (high-dimensional data support recovery) and not in SAEs. 

The closest is perhaps the variance regularization work by Evtimova and LeCun, but they focus on variance per latent component rather than inter-feature covariance. The UAE (Unmixing Autoencoder) uses sparse regularization for hyperspectral data, but again, not covariance between latents. 

Given that the core idea of dynamically selecting and penalizing the top-k correlated feature pairs in SAEs hasn't been found in the literature so far, and considering the specific application to SCR/TPP benchmarks for interpretability, it seems the idea is novel. The previous searches haven't turned up any papers that combine these elements. Therefore, after thorough checking, the decision is that this approach hasn't been significantly explored in existing works.

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine. The experimental results show that the proposed KT-SAE method has improved transfer accuracy compared to other related transfer learning methods.\n\n1: Estimation of sparse covariance matrix via non-convex regularization.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

[{\'authorId\': \'2267557643\', \'name\': \'Chen Jing\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2267714756\', \'name\': \'Caixia Gao\'}]. Frontiers of Chinese Pure Mathematics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Linear discriminant analysis plays an important role in feature extraction, data dimensionality reduction, and classification. With the progress of science and technology, the data that need to be processed are becoming increasingly large. However, in high-dimensional situations, linear discriminant analysis faces two problems: the lack of interpretability of the projected data since they all involve all p features, which are linear combinations of all features, as well as the singularity problem of the within-class covariance matrix. There are three different arguments for linear discriminant analysis: multivariate Gaussian model, Fisher discrimination problem, and optimal scoring problem. To solve these two problems, this article establishes a model for solving the kth discriminant component, which first transforms the original model of Fisher discriminant problem in linear discriminant analysis by using a diagonal estimated matrix for the within-class variance in place of the original within-class covariance matrix, which overcomes the singularity problem of the matrix and projects it to an orthogonal projection space to remove its orthogonal constraints, and subsequently an lq norm regularization term is added to enhance its interpretability for the purpose of dimensionality reduction and classification. Finally, an iterative algorithm for solving the model and a convergence analysis are given, and it is proved that the sequence generated by the algorithm is descended and converges to a local minimum of the problem for any initial value.\n\n1: An enhanced sparse autoencoder for machinery interpretable fault diagnosis.

Measurement science and technology, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 3\nAbstract: The interpretability of individual components within existing autoencoders remains insufficiently explored. This paper aims to address this gap by delving into the interpretability of the encoding and decoding structures and their correlation with the physical significance of vibrational signals. To achieve this, the Sparse Coding with Multi-layer Decoders (SC-MD) model is proposed, which facilitates fault diagnosis from two perspectives: the working principles of the model itself and the evolving trends of fault features. Specifically, a sparse coding protocol to prevent L1-norm collapse is proposed in the encoding process, regularizing the encoding to ensure that each latent code component possesses variance greater than a fixed threshold on a set of sparse representations given the input data. Subsequently, a multi-layer decoder structure is designed to capture the intricate mapping relationship between features and fault patterns. Finally, the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) is employed as the solver for the SC-MD model, enabling end-to-end updates of all parameters by unfolding FISTA. The coherent theoretical framework ensures the interpretability of SC-MD. Utilizing aeroengine bearing data, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed approach under both normal conditions and intense noise, as compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.\n\n2: Enhancing Neural Network Interpretability with Feature-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders.

We propose \\textsc{Mutual Feature Regularization} \\textbf{(MFR)}, a regularization technique for improving feature learning by encouraging SAEs trained in parallel to learn similar features. We motivate \\textsc{MFR} by showing that features learned by multiple SAEs are more likely to correlate with features of the input. By training on synthetic data with known features of the input, we show that \\textsc{MFR} can help SAEs learn those features, as we can directly compare the features learned by the SAE with the input features for the synthetic data. We then scale \\textsc{MFR} to SAEs that are trained to denoise electroencephalography (EEG) data and SAEs that are trained to reconstruct GPT-2 Small activations. We show that \\textsc{MFR} can improve the reconstruction loss of SAEs by up to 21.21\\% on GPT-2 Small, and 6.67\\% on EEG data. Our results suggest that the similarity between features learned by different SAEs can be leveraged to improve SAE training, thereby enhancing performance and the usefulness of SAEs for model interpretability.\n\n3: SPARSE REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF DATA BY AUTOENCODERS WITH L 1 / 2 REGULARIZATION.

Sparse representation can improve the interpretability of the input data and the generalization of a model by eliminating redundant features and extracting the latent structure of data. In this paper, we use L1/2 regularization method to enforce sparsity on the hidden representation of an autoencoder for achieving sparse representation of data. The performance of our approach in terms of unsupervised feature learning and supervised classification is assessed on the MNIST digit data set, the ORL face database and the Reuters-21578 text corpus. The results demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder can produce sparser representation and better reconstruction performance than the Sparse Autoencoder and the L1 regularization Autoencoder. The new representation is also illustrated to be useful for a deep network to improve the classification performance.\n\n4: Disentangled representation learning with physics-informed variational autoencoder for structural health monitoring.

Labor intensive manual inspection and assessment on a large scale is often infeasible, while data-driven machine learning techniques can fail to identify relevant failure mechanisms and suffer from poor generalization to previously unseen conditions, particularly when data is sparse. We propose a multi-task learning approach based on a physics-informed variational autoencoder that leverages a dictionary of physics-based models to improve the predictive performance when limited data is available. The latent space of the autoencoder is augmented with a set of physics-based latent variables that are interpretable and allow for prior knowledge on the latent variables to be included in the autoencoder formulation. To prevent the data-driven components of the encoder and decoder from overriding the known physics, a regularization method is used to impose physical constraints on the latent space and the generative model prediction. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study of quay walls in Amsterdam, demonstrating improved performance over purely data-driven methods. \n\n\n5: Unmixing Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction from Hyperspectral Data..

Analytical Chemistry, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Due to the complexity of samples and the limitations in spatial resolution, the spectra in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are generally contributed to by multiple components, making univariate analysis ineffective. Although feature extraction methods have been applied, the chemical meaning of the compressed variables is difficult to interpret, limiting their further applications. An unmixing autoencoder (UAE) was developed in this work for the separation of the mixed spectra in HSI. The proposed model is composed of an encoder and a fully connected (FC) layer. The former is used to compress the input spectrum into several variables, and the latter is employed to reconstruct the spectrum. Combining reconstruction loss and sparse regularization, the weights and the spectral profiles of the components will be encoded in the compressed variables and the connection weights of FC, respectively. A simulated and three experimental HSI data sets were adopted to investigate the performance of the UAE model. The spectral components were successfully obtained, from which the handwriting under papers was revealed from the image of near-infrared (NIR) diffusive reflectance spectroscopy, and the images of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids were reconstructed from the Raman and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) images.\n\n6: Sparse deep encoded features with enhanced sinogramic red deer optimization for fault inspection in wafer maps.

Stat, 2017.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: For high‐dimensional data, the standard empirical estimator for the covariance matrix is very poor, and thus many methods have been proposed to more accurately estimate the covariance structure of high‐dimensional data. In this article, we consider estimation under the assumption of sparsity but regularize with respect to the individual false‐positive rate for incorrectly including a matrix entry in the support of the final estimator. The two benefits of this approach are (1) an interpretable regularization parameter removing the need for computationally expensive tuning and (2) extremely fast computation time arising from use of a binary search algorithm implemented to find the best estimator within a carefully constructed operator norm ball. We compare our approach to universal thresholding estimators and lasso‐style penalized estimators on both simulated data and data from gene expression for cancerous tumours.\n\n8: Sparse Coding with Multi-Layer Decoders using Variance Regularization. [{\'authorId\': \'13188440\', \'name\': \'Katrina Evtimova\'}, {\'authorId\': \'1688882\', \'name\': \'Yann LeCun\'}]. Trans. Mach. Learn. Res., 2021.\nNumber of citations: 9\nAbstract: Sparse representations of images are useful in many computer vision applications. Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear dictionary requires regularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in the $l_1$ norms of the codes. Typically, this regularization entails bounding the Euclidean norms of the dictionary\'s elements. In this work, we propose a novel sparse coding protocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the need to regularize the decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so that each latent code component has variance greater than a fixed threshold over a set of sparse representations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we explore ways to effectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer decoders since they can model more complex relationships than linear dictionaries. In our experiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show that decoders learned with our approach have interpretable features both in the linear and multi-layer case. Moreover, we show that sparse autoencoders with multi-layer decoders trained using our variance regularization method produce higher quality reconstructions with sparser representations when compared to autoencoders with linear dictionaries. Additionally, sparse representations obtained with our variance regularization approach are useful in the downstream tasks of denoising and classification in the low-data regime.\n\n9: Non-linear, Sparse Dimensionality Reduction via Path Lasso Penalized Autoencoders.

Journal of machine learning research, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: High-dimensional data sets are often analyzed and explored via the construction of a latent low-dimensional space which enables convenient visualization and efficient predictive modeling or clustering. For complex data structures, linear dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA may not be sufficiently flexible to enable low-dimensional representation. Non-linear dimension reduction techniques, like kernel PCA and autoencoders, suffer from loss of interpretability since each latent variable is dependent of all input dimensions. To address this limitation, we here present path lasso penalized autoencoders. This structured regularization enhances interpretability by penalizing each path through the encoder from an input to a latent variable, thus restricting how many input variables are represented in each latent dimension. Our algorithm uses a group lasso penalty and non-negative matrix factorization to construct a sparse, non-linear latent representation. We compare the path lasso regularized autoencoder to PCA, sparse PCA, autoencoders and sparse autoencoders on real and simulated data sets. We show that the algorithm exhibits much lower reconstruction errors than sparse PCA and parameter-wise lasso regularized autoencoders for low-dimensional representations. Moreover, path lasso representations provide a more accurate reconstruction match, i.e. preserved relative distance between objects in the original and reconstructed spaces.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine. The experimental results show that the proposed KT-SAE method has improved transfer accuracy compared to other related transfer learning methods.\n\n1: Estimation of sparse covariance matrix via non-convex regularization.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Ni\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2108631516\', \'name\': \'Li-Xin Wang\'}]. Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 2020.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: In sparse DOA estimation methods, the regularization parameter λ is generally empirically tuned. In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

[{\'authorId\': \'2267557643\', \'name\': \'Chen Jing\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2267714756\', \'name\': \'Caixia Gao\'}]. Frontiers of Chinese Pure Mathematics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Linear discriminant analysis plays an important role in feature extraction, data dimensionality reduction, and classification. With the progress of science and technology, the data that need to be processed are becoming increasingly large. However, in high-dimensional situations, linear discriminant analysis faces two problems: the lack of interpretability of the projected data since they all involve all p features, which are linear combinations of all features, as well as the singularity problem of the within-class covariance matrix. There are three different arguments for linear discriminant analysis: multivariate Gaussian model, Fisher discrimination problem, and optimal scoring problem. To solve these two problems, this article establishes a model for solving the kth discriminant component, which first transforms the original model of Fisher discriminant problem in linear discriminant analysis by using a diagonal estimated matrix for the within-class variance in place of the original within-class covariance matrix, which overcomes the singularity problem of the matrix and projects it to an orthogonal projection space to remove its orthogonal constraints, and subsequently an lq norm regularization term is added to enhance its interpretability for the purpose of dimensionality reduction and classification. Finally, an iterative algorithm for solving the model and a convergence analysis are given, and it is proved that the sequence generated by the algorithm is descended and converges to a local minimum of the problem for any initial value.\n\n1: An enhanced sparse autoencoder for machinery interpretable fault diagnosis.

This paper aims to address this gap by delving into the interpretability of the encoding and decoding structures and their correlation with the physical significance of vibrational signals. To achieve this, the Sparse Coding with Multi-layer Decoders (SC-MD) model is proposed, which facilitates fault diagnosis from two perspectives: the working principles of the model itself and the evolving trends of fault features. Specifically, a sparse coding protocol to prevent L1-norm collapse is proposed in the encoding process, regularizing the encoding to ensure that each latent code component possesses variance greater than a fixed threshold on a set of sparse representations given the input data. Subsequently, a multi-layer decoder structure is designed to capture the intricate mapping relationship between features and fault patterns. Finally, the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) is employed as the solver for the SC-MD model, enabling end-to-end updates of all parameters by unfolding FISTA. The coherent theoretical framework ensures the interpretability of SC-MD. Utilizing aeroengine bearing data, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed approach under both normal conditions and intense noise, as compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.\n\n2: Enhancing Neural Network Interpretability with Feature-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders.

We propose \\textsc{Mutual Feature Regularization} \\textbf{(MFR)}, a regularization technique for improving feature learning by encouraging SAEs trained in parallel to learn similar features. We motivate \\textsc{MFR} by showing that features learned by multiple SAEs are more likely to correlate with features of the input. By training on synthetic data with known features of the input, we show that \\textsc{MFR} can help SAEs learn those features, as we can directly compare the features learned by the SAE with the input features for the synthetic data. We then scale \\textsc{MFR} to SAEs that are trained to denoise electroencephalography (EEG) data and SAEs that are trained to reconstruct GPT-2 Small activations. We show that \\textsc{MFR} can improve the reconstruction loss of SAEs by up to 21.21\\% on GPT-2 Small, and 6.67\\% on EEG data. Our results suggest that the similarity between features learned by different SAEs can be leveraged to improve SAE training, thereby enhancing performance and the usefulness of SAEs for model interpretability.\n\n3: SPARSE REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF DATA BY AUTOENCODERS WITH L 1 / 2 REGULARIZATION.

Sparse representation can improve the interpretability of the input data and the generalization of a model by eliminating redundant features and extracting the latent structure of data. In this paper, we use L1/2 regularization method to enforce sparsity on the hidden representation of an autoencoder for achieving sparse representation of data. The performance of our approach in terms of unsupervised feature learning and supervised classification is assessed on the MNIST digit data set, the ORL face database and the Reuters-21578 text corpus. The results demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder can produce sparser representation and better reconstruction performance than the Sparse Autoencoder and the L1 regularization Autoencoder. The new representation is also illustrated to be useful for a deep network to improve the classification performance.\n\n4: Disentangled representation learning with physics-informed variational autoencoder for structural health monitoring.

Labor intensive manual inspection and assessment on a large scale is often infeasible, while data-driven machine learning techniques can fail to identify relevant failure mechanisms and suffer from poor generalization to previously unseen conditions, particularly when data is sparse. We propose a multi-task learning approach based on a physics-informed variational autoencoder that leverages a dictionary of physics-based models to improve the predictive performance when limited data is available. The latent space of the autoencoder is augmented with a set of physics-based latent variables that are interpretable and allow for prior knowledge on the latent variables to be included in the autoencoder formulation. To prevent the data-driven components of the encoder and decoder from overriding the known physics, a regularization method is used to impose physical constraints on the latent space and the generative model prediction. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study of quay walls in Amsterdam, demonstrating improved performance over purely data-driven methods. \n\n\n5: Unmixing Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction from Hyperspectral Data..

Analytical Chemistry, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Due to the complexity of samples and the limitations in spatial resolution, the spectra in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are generally contributed to by multiple components, making univariate analysis ineffective. Although feature extraction methods have been applied, the chemical meaning of the compressed variables is difficult to interpret, limiting their further applications. An unmixing autoencoder (UAE) was developed in this work for the separation of the mixed spectra in HSI. The proposed model is composed of an encoder and a fully connected (FC) layer. The former is used to compress the input spectrum into several variables, and the latter is employed to reconstruct the spectrum. Combining reconstruction loss and sparse regularization, the weights and the spectral profiles of the components will be encoded in the compressed variables and the connection weights of FC, respectively. A simulated and three experimental HSI data sets were adopted to investigate the performance of the UAE model. The spectral components were successfully obtained, from which the handwriting under papers was revealed from the image of near-infrared (NIR) diffusive reflectance spectroscopy, and the images of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids were reconstructed from the Raman and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) images.\n\n6: Sparse deep encoded features with enhanced sinogramic red deer optimization for fault inspection in wafer maps.

Stat, 2017.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: For high‐dimensional data, the standard empirical estimator for the covariance matrix is very poor, and thus many methods have been proposed to more accurately estimate the covariance structure of high‐dimensional data. In this article, we consider estimation under the assumption of sparsity but regularize with respect to the individual false‐positive rate for incorrectly including a matrix entry in the support of the final estimator. The two benefits of this approach are (1) an interpretable regularization parameter removing the need for computationally expensive tuning and (2) extremely fast computation time arising from use of a binary search algorithm implemented to find the best estimator within a carefully constructed operator norm ball. We compare our approach to universal thresholding estimators and lasso‐style penalized estimators on both simulated data and data from gene expression for cancerous tumours.\n\n8: Sparse Coding with Multi-Layer Decoders using Variance Regularization. [{\'authorId\': \'13188440\', \'name\': \'Katrina Evtimova\'}, {\'authorId\': \'1688882\', \'name\': \'Yann LeCun\'}]. Trans. Mach. Learn. Res., 2021.\nNumber of citations: 9\nAbstract: Sparse representations of images are useful in many computer vision applications. Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear dictionary requires regularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in the $l_1$ norms of the codes. Typically, this regularization entails bounding the Euclidean norms of the dictionary\'s elements. In this work, we propose a novel sparse coding protocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the need to regularize the decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so that each latent code component has variance greater than a fixed threshold over a set of sparse representations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we explore ways to effectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer decoders since they can model more complex relationships than linear dictionaries. In our experiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show that decoders learned with our approach have interpretable features both in the linear and multi-layer case. Moreover, we show that sparse autoencoders with multi-layer decoders trained using our variance regularization method produce higher quality reconstructions with sparser representations when compared to autoencoders with linear dictionaries. Additionally, sparse representations obtained with our variance regularization approach are useful in the downstream tasks of denoising and classification in the low-data regime.\n\n9: Non-linear, Sparse Dimensionality Reduction via Path Lasso Penalized Autoencoders. [{\'authorId\': \'4013089\', \'name\': \'Oskar Allerbo\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2088825\', \'name\': \'Rebecka Jörnsten\'}]. Journal of machine learning research, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: High-dimensional data sets are often analyzed and explored via the construction of a latent low-dimensional space which enables convenient visualization and efficient predictive modeling or clustering. For complex data structures, linear dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA may not be sufficiently flexible to enable low-dimensional representation. Non-linear dimension reduction techniques, like kernel PCA and autoencoders, suffer from loss of interpretability since each latent variable is dependent of all input dimensions. To address this limitation, we here present path lasso penalized autoencoders. This structured regularization enhances interpretability by penalizing each path through the encoder from an input to a latent variable, thus restricting how many input variables are represented in each latent dimension. Our algorithm uses a group lasso penalty and non-negative matrix factorization to construct a sparse, non-linear latent representation. We compare the path lasso regularized autoencoder to PCA, sparse PCA, autoencoders and sparse autoencoders on real and simulated data sets. We show that the algorithm exhibits much lower reconstruction errors than sparse PCA and parameter-wise lasso regularized autoencoders for low-dimensional representations. Moreover, path lasso representations provide a more accurate reconstruction match, i.e. preserved relative distance between objects in the original and reconstructed spaces.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine.

Geophysics, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: The increasing use of sparse acquisitions in seismic data acquisition offers advantages in cost and time savings. However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

With the progress of science and technology, the data that need to be processed are becoming increasingly large. However, in high-dimensional situations, linear discriminant analysis faces two problems: the lack of interpretability of the projected data since they all involve all p features, which are linear combinations of all features, as well as the singularity problem of the within-class covariance matrix. There are three different arguments for linear discriminant analysis: multivariate Gaussian model, Fisher discrimination problem, and optimal scoring problem. To solve these two problems, this article establishes a model for solving the kth discriminant component, which first transforms the original model of Fisher discriminant problem in linear discriminant analysis by using a diagonal estimated matrix for the within-class variance in place of the original within-class covariance matrix, which overcomes the singularity problem of the matrix and projects it to an orthogonal projection space to remove its orthogonal constraints, and subsequently an lq norm regularization term is added to enhance its interpretability for the purpose of dimensionality reduction and classification. Finally, an iterative algorithm for solving the model and a convergence analysis are given, and it is proved that the sequence generated by the algorithm is descended and converges to a local minimum of the problem for any initial value.\n\n1: An enhanced sparse autoencoder for machinery interpretable fault diagnosis.

This paper aims to address this gap by delving into the interpretability of the encoding and decoding structures and their correlation with the physical significance of vibrational signals. To achieve this, the Sparse Coding with Multi-layer Decoders (SC-MD) model is proposed, which facilitates fault diagnosis from two perspectives: the working principles of the model itself and the evolving trends of fault features. Specifically, a sparse coding protocol to prevent L1-norm collapse is proposed in the encoding process, regularizing the encoding to ensure that each latent code component possesses variance greater than a fixed threshold on a set of sparse representations given the input data. Subsequently, a multi-layer decoder structure is designed to capture the intricate mapping relationship between features and fault patterns. Finally, the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) is employed as the solver for the SC-MD model, enabling end-to-end updates of all parameters by unfolding FISTA. The coherent theoretical framework ensures the interpretability of SC-MD.

We propose \\textsc{Mutual Feature Regularization} \\textbf{(MFR)}, a regularization technique for improving feature learning by encouraging SAEs trained in parallel to learn similar features. We motivate \\textsc{MFR} by showing that features learned by multiple SAEs are more likely to correlate with features of the input. By training on synthetic data with known features of the input, we show that \\textsc{MFR} can help SAEs learn those features, as we can directly compare the features learned by the SAE with the input features for the synthetic data. We then scale \\textsc{MFR} to SAEs that are trained to denoise electroencephalography (EEG) data and SAEs that are trained to reconstruct GPT-2 Small activations. We show that \\textsc{MFR} can improve the reconstruction loss of SAEs by up to 21.21\\% on GPT-2 Small, and 6.67\\% on EEG data. Our results suggest that the similarity between features learned by different SAEs can be leveraged to improve SAE training, thereby enhancing performance and the usefulness of SAEs for model interpretability.\n\n3: SPARSE REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF DATA BY AUTOENCODERS WITH L 1 / 2 REGULARIZATION.

Sparse representation can improve the interpretability of the input data and the generalization of a model by eliminating redundant features and extracting the latent structure of data. In this paper, we use L1/2 regularization method to enforce sparsity on the hidden representation of an autoencoder for achieving sparse representation of data. The performance of our approach in terms of unsupervised feature learning and supervised classification is assessed on the MNIST digit data set, the ORL face database and the Reuters-21578 text corpus. The results demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder can produce sparser representation and better reconstruction performance than the Sparse Autoencoder and the L1 regularization Autoencoder. The new representation is also illustrated to be useful for a deep network to improve the classification performance.\n\n4: Disentangled representation learning with physics-informed variational autoencoder for structural health monitoring.

Labor intensive manual inspection and assessment on a large scale is often infeasible, while data-driven machine learning techniques can fail to identify relevant failure mechanisms and suffer from poor generalization to previously unseen conditions, particularly when data is sparse. We propose a multi-task learning approach based on a physics-informed variational autoencoder that leverages a dictionary of physics-based models to improve the predictive performance when limited data is available. The latent space of the autoencoder is augmented with a set of physics-based latent variables that are interpretable and allow for prior knowledge on the latent variables to be included in the autoencoder formulation. To prevent the data-driven components of the encoder and decoder from overriding the known physics, a regularization method is used to impose physical constraints on the latent space and the generative model prediction. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study of quay walls in Amsterdam, demonstrating improved performance over purely data-driven methods. \n\n\n5: Unmixing Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction from Hyperspectral Data..

Analytical Chemistry, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Due to the complexity of samples and the limitations in spatial resolution, the spectra in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are generally contributed to by multiple components, making univariate analysis ineffective. Although feature extraction methods have been applied, the chemical meaning of the compressed variables is difficult to interpret, limiting their further applications. An unmixing autoencoder (UAE) was developed in this work for the separation of the mixed spectra in HSI. The proposed model is composed of an encoder and a fully connected (FC) layer. The former is used to compress the input spectrum into several variables, and the latter is employed to reconstruct the spectrum. Combining reconstruction loss and sparse regularization, the weights and the spectral profiles of the components will be encoded in the compressed variables and the connection weights of FC, respectively. A simulated and three experimental HSI data sets were adopted to investigate the performance of the UAE model. The spectral components were successfully obtained, from which the handwriting under papers was revealed from the image of near-infrared (NIR) diffusive reflectance spectroscopy, and the images of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids were reconstructed from the Raman and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) images.\n\n6: Sparse deep encoded features with enhanced sinogramic red deer optimization for fault inspection in wafer maps.

Stat, 2017.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: For high‐dimensional data, the standard empirical estimator for the covariance matrix is very poor, and thus many methods have been proposed to more accurately estimate the covariance structure of high‐dimensional data. In this article, we consider estimation under the assumption of sparsity but regularize with respect to the individual false‐positive rate for incorrectly including a matrix entry in the support of the final estimator. The two benefits of this approach are (1) an interpretable regularization parameter removing the need for computationally expensive tuning and (2) extremely fast computation time arising from use of a binary search algorithm implemented to find the best estimator within a carefully constructed operator norm ball. We compare our approach to universal thresholding estimators and lasso‐style penalized estimators on both simulated data and data from gene expression for cancerous tumours.\n\n8: Sparse Coding with Multi-Layer Decoders using Variance Regularization. [{\'authorId\': \'13188440\', \'name\': \'Katrina Evtimova\'}, {\'authorId\': \'1688882\', \'name\': \'Yann LeCun\'}]. Trans. Mach. Learn. Res., 2021.\nNumber of citations: 9\nAbstract: Sparse representations of images are useful in many computer vision applications. Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear dictionary requires regularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in the $l_1$ norms of the codes. Typically, this regularization entails bounding the Euclidean norms of the dictionary\'s elements. In this work, we propose a novel sparse coding protocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the need to regularize the decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so that each latent code component has variance greater than a fixed threshold over a set of sparse representations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we explore ways to effectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer decoders since they can model more complex relationships than linear dictionaries. In our experiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show that decoders learned with our approach have interpretable features both in the linear and multi-layer case. Moreover, we show that sparse autoencoders with multi-layer decoders trained using our variance regularization method produce higher quality reconstructions with sparser representations when compared to autoencoders with linear dictionaries. Additionally, sparse representations obtained with our variance regularization approach are useful in the downstream tasks of denoising and classification in the low-data regime.\n\n9: Non-linear, Sparse Dimensionality Reduction via Path Lasso Penalized Autoencoders. [{\'authorId\': \'4013089\', \'name\': \'Oskar Allerbo\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2088825\', \'name\': \'Rebecka Jörnsten\'}]. Journal of machine learning research, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: High-dimensional data sets are often analyzed and explored via the construction of a latent low-dimensional space which enables convenient visualization and efficient predictive modeling or clustering. For complex data structures, linear dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA may not be sufficiently flexible to enable low-dimensional representation. Non-linear dimension reduction techniques, like kernel PCA and autoencoders, suffer from loss of interpretability since each latent variable is dependent of all input dimensions. To address this limitation, we here present path lasso penalized autoencoders. This structured regularization enhances interpretability by penalizing each path through the encoder from an input to a latent variable, thus restricting how many input variables are represented in each latent dimension. Our algorithm uses a group lasso penalty and non-negative matrix factorization to construct a sparse, non-linear latent representation. We compare the path lasso regularized autoencoder to PCA, sparse PCA, autoencoders and sparse autoencoders on real and simulated data sets. We show that the algorithm exhibits much lower reconstruction errors than sparse PCA and parameter-wise lasso regularized autoencoders for low-dimensional representations. Moreover, path lasso representations provide a more accurate reconstruction match, i.e. preserved relative distance between objects in the original and reconstructed spaces.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

reasoning_content is Okay, let's wrap this up. The user's idea is about using a sparse covariance regularization in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to improve interpretability of latent features. The key innovation here is the dynamic top-k selection of the most correlated feature pairs to apply regularization, aiming to reduce polysemanticity. 

Looking back at the previous rounds, several related papers were found, but none exactly match this approach. Papers like the one by Marks et al. (2024) introduced mutual feature regularization but didn't focus on covariance. Evtimova and LeCun (2021) used variance regularization, which is somewhat related but not the same as targeting covariance between features. The SC-MD model by Niu et al. (2024) also dealt with sparsity but used a different regularization strategy.

The core elements here—dynamic top-k covariance regularization, SCR/TPP benchmarks, and addressing feature absorption—haven't been mentioned in the found literature. Existing works use various regularization techniques but not this specific combination of adaptive covariance targeting. Since the last query didn't find any overlapping papers, it's likely that this approach hasn't been explored yet. Thus, the idea seems novel. Decision made: novel.

In practical condition monitoring scenarios, the individual differences among equipment often decrease the accuracy of diagnostic models. To tackle this problem, a transfer learning method based on stacked sparse autoencoder is proposed, which employs a data regularization strategy to improve feature extraction ability. The fault diagnosis model trained in the cloud transfers its model parameters and structure to the edge side. By a finetuning process with a small amount of data, and the model is further updated for condition monitoring of the individual machine.

However, it results in irregularly sampled seismic data, adversely impacting the quality of the final images. In this paper, we propose the ResFFT-CAE network, a convolutional neural network with residual blocks based on the Fourier transform. Incorporating residual blocks allows the network to extract both high- and low-frequency features from the seismic data. The high-frequency features capture detailed information, while the low-frequency features integrate the overall data structure, facilitating superior recovery of irregularly sampled seismic data in the trace and shot domains. We evaluated the performance of the ResFFT-CAE network on both synthetic and field data. On synthetic data, we compared the ResFFT-CAE network with the compressive sensing (CS) method utilizing the curvelet transform. For field data, we conducted comparisons with other neural networks, including the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and U-Net. The results demonstrated that the ResFFT-CAE network consistently outperformed other approaches in all scenarios. It produced images of superior quality, characterized by lower residuals and reduced distortions. Furthermore, when evaluating model generalization, tests using models trained on synthetic data also exhibited promising results. In conclusion, the ResFFT-CAE network shows great promise as a highly efficient tool for the regularizing irregularly sampled seismic data. Its excellent performance suggests potential applications in the preconditioning of seismic data analysis and processing flows.\n\n3: An Adaptive Sparse Regularization Method for Response Covariance-Based Structural Damage Detection.

Structural Control & Health Monitoring, 2023.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: Structural damage detection is usually an ill-posed inverse problem due to the contamination of measurement noise and model error in structural health monitoring. To deal with the ill-posed damage detection problem, l2-regularization is widely used. However, l2-regularization tends to provide nonsparse solutions and distribute identified damage to many undamaged elements, potentially leading to false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive sparse regularization method is proposed, which considers spatially sparse damage as a prior constraint since structural damage often occurs in some locations with stiffness reduction at the sparse elements out of the large total number of elements in an entire structure. First, a response covariance-based convex cost function is established by incorporating an l1-regularized term and an adaptive regularization factor to formulate the sparse regularization-based damage detection problem. Then, optimal sensor placement is conducted to determine the optimal measurement locations where the acceleration responses are adopted for computing the response covariance-based damage index and cost function. Further, the predictor-corrector primal-dual path-following approach, an efficient and robust convex optimization algorithm, is applied to search for solutions to the damage detection problem. Finally, a comparison study with the Tikhonov regularization-based damage detection method is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed adaptive sparse regularization-based method by using an overhanging beam model subjected to different damage scenarios and noise levels. The numerical study demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify damage under multiple damage scenarios with various noise levels, and it outperforms the Tikhonov regularization-based method in terms of high accuracy and few false alarms. The analyses on time consumption, adaptiveness of the sparse regularization factor, model-error resistance, and sensor number influence are conducted for further discussions of the proposed method.\n\n4: Mental Resilience Among Women Using Sparse Autoencoder and Self-Training Ensemble.

This paper introduces an innovative approach employing Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Ensemble Techniques to detect mental strength patterns within a dataset focused on participants\' psychological functioning. We used CTGAN, an AI-driven method, to generate synthetic data to address data scarcity. This was followed by a combination of techniques, including Random Oversampling to augment the dataset and the application of a Synthetic Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) to perform feature extraction. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitated efficient dimensionality reduction, expediting model training. Building on this, we implemented a Self-Training Ensemble Model (STEM), integrating logistic regression, random forest classification, and naive Bayes classifiers. This ensemble approach, bolstered by labeled and sparse regularization, enhanced the model\'s ability to identify mental health indicators within the women-focused dataset. Our methodology demonstrated compelling results, achieving an accuracy of 0.779. This approach holds promise in augmenting mental health analysis, especially within datasets concerning women\'s psychological functioning, where data limitations pose significant challenges. The proposed method offers potential for early detection and targeted interventions, significantly impacting mental health care.\n\n5: Embedded stacked group sparse autoencoder ensemble with L1 regularization and manifold reduction.

In this paper, we provide a statistical method allowing to estimate an admissible interval where λ must be chosen. This work is conducted in the case of an Uniform Circular Array, well known for its θ invariant performances, and vectorized covariance matrix observation. In the recent work [1], it is shown that the equivalence between the ℓ0-constrained problem and the corresponding regularized one is obtained for λ belonging to a given interval. This interval is conditional to an observation. The purpose of this work is to generalize this result for stochastic observations, providing so an interval I of λ valid in all scenarios for an UCA. This interval is not data dependent. Simulation results validate the proposed approach.\n\n8: Sparse Clustering Algorithm Based on Multi-Domain Dimensionality Reduction Autoencoder.

Mathematics, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 1\nAbstract: The key to high-dimensional clustering lies in discovering the intrinsic structures and patterns in data to provide valuable information. However, high-dimensional clustering faces enormous challenges such as dimensionality disaster, increased data sparsity, and reduced reliability of the clustering results. In order to address these issues, we propose a sparse clustering algorithm based on a multi-domain dimensionality reduction model. This method achieves high-dimensional clustering by integrating the sparse reconstruction process and sparse L1 regularization into a deep autoencoder model. A sparse reconstruction module is designed based on the L1 sparse reconstruction of features under different domains to reconstruct the data. The proposed method mainly contributes in two aspects. Firstly, the spatial and frequency domains are combined by taking into account the spatial distribution and frequency characteristics of the data to provide multiple perspectives and choices for data analysis and processing. Then, a neural network-based clustering model with sparsity is conducted by projecting data points onto multi-domains and implementing adaptive regularization penalty terms to the weight matrix. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in handling clustering problems on high-dimensional datasets.\n\n9: An Innovative PolSAR Image Classification Method Based on Non-Negative Constraints Stacked Sparse Autoencoder Network with Multi-Features Joint Representation Learning.

Firstly, the corresponding 6-dimensional real vector is obtained from the covariance matrix of PolSAR data and combined with the polarized feature vector obtained by the polarization decomposition method to improve the differentiation ability of similar features in images. Secondly, the stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is employed, where the non-negative constraint method is incorporated to make the sparse features in the depth space robust by filtering the weights. Finally, a non-negative constrained SSAE model is proposed to effectively accomplish the classification task of PolSAR images. In the experiments, the proposed classification network is trained layer by layer using unlabeled data, the softmax classifier is trained with a small number of labeled pixels. The parameters obtained from the above steps are used as initial parameters to train the entire classification framework with labeled pixels, the resulting well-trained model is used to predict the labels corresponding to pixels in the datasets. Through experiments using the Flevoland and San Francisco Bay datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior classification results compared with traditional SVM, AE, and Gray Level Co-generation Matrix (GLCM) classification methods.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).

With the progress of science and technology, the data that need to be processed are becoming increasingly large. However, in high-dimensional situations, linear discriminant analysis faces two problems: the lack of interpretability of the projected data since they all involve all p features, which are linear combinations of all features, as well as the singularity problem of the within-class covariance matrix. There are three different arguments for linear discriminant analysis: multivariate Gaussian model, Fisher discrimination problem, and optimal scoring problem. To solve these two problems, this article establishes a model for solving the kth discriminant component, which first transforms the original model of Fisher discriminant problem in linear discriminant analysis by using a diagonal estimated matrix for the within-class variance in place of the original within-class covariance matrix, which overcomes the singularity problem of the matrix and projects it to an orthogonal projection space to remove its orthogonal constraints, and subsequently an lq norm regularization term is added to enhance its interpretability for the purpose of dimensionality reduction and classification. Finally, an iterative algorithm for solving the model and a convergence analysis are given, and it is proved that the sequence generated by the algorithm is descended and converges to a local minimum of the problem for any initial value.\n\n1: An enhanced sparse autoencoder for machinery interpretable fault diagnosis.

This paper aims to address this gap by delving into the interpretability of the encoding and decoding structures and their correlation with the physical significance of vibrational signals. To achieve this, the Sparse Coding with Multi-layer Decoders (SC-MD) model is proposed, which facilitates fault diagnosis from two perspectives: the working principles of the model itself and the evolving trends of fault features. Specifically, a sparse coding protocol to prevent L1-norm collapse is proposed in the encoding process, regularizing the encoding to ensure that each latent code component possesses variance greater than a fixed threshold on a set of sparse representations given the input data. Subsequently, a multi-layer decoder structure is designed to capture the intricate mapping relationship between features and fault patterns. Finally, the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) is employed as the solver for the SC-MD model, enabling end-to-end updates of all parameters by unfolding FISTA. The coherent theoretical framework ensures the interpretability of SC-MD. Utilizing aeroengine bearing data, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed approach under both normal conditions and intense noise, as compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.\n\n2: Enhancing Neural Network Interpretability with Feature-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders.

We propose \\textsc{Mutual Feature Regularization} \\textbf{(MFR)}, a regularization technique for improving feature learning by encouraging SAEs trained in parallel to learn similar features. We motivate \\textsc{MFR} by showing that features learned by multiple SAEs are more likely to correlate with features of the input. By training on synthetic data with known features of the input, we show that \\textsc{MFR} can help SAEs learn those features, as we can directly compare the features learned by the SAE with the input features for the synthetic data. We then scale \\textsc{MFR} to SAEs that are trained to denoise electroencephalography (EEG) data and SAEs that are trained to reconstruct GPT-2 Small activations. We show that \\textsc{MFR} can improve the reconstruction loss of SAEs by up to 21.21\\% on GPT-2 Small, and 6.67\\% on EEG data. Our results suggest that the similarity between features learned by different SAEs can be leveraged to improve SAE training, thereby enhancing performance and the usefulness of SAEs for model interpretability.\n\n3: SPARSE REPRESENTATION LEARNING OF DATA BY AUTOENCODERS WITH L 1 / 2 REGULARIZATION.

Sparse representation can improve the interpretability of the input data and the generalization of a model by eliminating redundant features and extracting the latent structure of data. In this paper, we use L1/2 regularization method to enforce sparsity on the hidden representation of an autoencoder for achieving sparse representation of data. The performance of our approach in terms of unsupervised feature learning and supervised classification is assessed on the MNIST digit data set, the ORL face database and the Reuters-21578 text corpus. The results demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder can produce sparser representation and better reconstruction performance than the Sparse Autoencoder and the L1 regularization Autoencoder. The new representation is also illustrated to be useful for a deep network to improve the classification performance.\n\n4: Disentangled representation learning with physics-informed variational autoencoder for structural health monitoring.

Labor intensive manual inspection and assessment on a large scale is often infeasible, while data-driven machine learning techniques can fail to identify relevant failure mechanisms and suffer from poor generalization to previously unseen conditions, particularly when data is sparse. We propose a multi-task learning approach based on a physics-informed variational autoencoder that leverages a dictionary of physics-based models to improve the predictive performance when limited data is available. The latent space of the autoencoder is augmented with a set of physics-based latent variables that are interpretable and allow for prior knowledge on the latent variables to be included in the autoencoder formulation. To prevent the data-driven components of the encoder and decoder from overriding the known physics, a regularization method is used to impose physical constraints on the latent space and the generative model prediction. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study of quay walls in Amsterdam, demonstrating improved performance over purely data-driven methods. \n\n\n5: Unmixing Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction from Hyperspectral Data.. [{\'authorId\': \'2239755397\', \'name\': \'Xuyang Liu\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2163325313\', \'name\': \'Chaoshu Duan\'}, {\'authorId\': \'34863745\', \'name\': \'W. Cai\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2131770289\', \'name\': \'Xueguang Shao\'}]. Analytical Chemistry, 2024.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: Due to the complexity of samples and the limitations in spatial resolution, the spectra in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are generally contributed to by multiple components, making univariate analysis ineffective. Although feature extraction methods have been applied, the chemical meaning of the compressed variables is difficult to interpret, limiting their further applications. An unmixing autoencoder (UAE) was developed in this work for the separation of the mixed spectra in HSI. The proposed model is composed of an encoder and a fully connected (FC) layer. The former is used to compress the input spectrum into several variables, and the latter is employed to reconstruct the spectrum. Combining reconstruction loss and sparse regularization, the weights and the spectral profiles of the components will be encoded in the compressed variables and the connection weights of FC, respectively. A simulated and three experimental HSI data sets were adopted to investigate the performance of the UAE model. The spectral components were successfully obtained, from which the handwriting under papers was revealed from the image of near-infrared (NIR) diffusive reflectance spectroscopy, and the images of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids were reconstructed from the Raman and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) images.\n\n6: Sparse deep encoded features with enhanced sinogramic red deer optimization for fault inspection in wafer maps.

Stat, 2017.\nNumber of citations: 4\nAbstract: For high‐dimensional data, the standard empirical estimator for the covariance matrix is very poor, and thus many methods have been proposed to more accurately estimate the covariance structure of high‐dimensional data. In this article, we consider estimation under the assumption of sparsity but regularize with respect to the individual false‐positive rate for incorrectly including a matrix entry in the support of the final estimator. The two benefits of this approach are (1) an interpretable regularization parameter removing the need for computationally expensive tuning and (2) extremely fast computation time arising from use of a binary search algorithm implemented to find the best estimator within a carefully constructed operator norm ball. We compare our approach to universal thresholding estimators and lasso‐style penalized estimators on both simulated data and data from gene expression for cancerous tumours.\n\n8: Sparse Coding with Multi-Layer Decoders using Variance Regularization. [{\'authorId\': \'13188440\', \'name\': \'Katrina Evtimova\'}, {\'authorId\': \'1688882\', \'name\': \'Yann LeCun\'}]. Trans. Mach. Learn. Res., 2021.\nNumber of citations: 9\nAbstract: Sparse representations of images are useful in many computer vision applications. Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear dictionary requires regularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in the $l_1$ norms of the codes. Typically, this regularization entails bounding the Euclidean norms of the dictionary\'s elements. In this work, we propose a novel sparse coding protocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the need to regularize the decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so that each latent code component has variance greater than a fixed threshold over a set of sparse representations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we explore ways to effectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer decoders since they can model more complex relationships than linear dictionaries. In our experiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show that decoders learned with our approach have interpretable features both in the linear and multi-layer case. Moreover, we show that sparse autoencoders with multi-layer decoders trained using our variance regularization method produce higher quality reconstructions with sparser representations when compared to autoencoders with linear dictionaries. Additionally, sparse representations obtained with our variance regularization approach are useful in the downstream tasks of denoising and classification in the low-data regime.\n\n9: Non-linear, Sparse Dimensionality Reduction via Path Lasso Penalized Autoencoders. [{\'authorId\': \'4013089\', \'name\': \'Oskar Allerbo\'}, {\'authorId\': \'2088825\', \'name\': \'Rebecka Jörnsten\'}]. Journal of machine learning research, 2021.\nNumber of citations: 0\nAbstract: High-dimensional data sets are often analyzed and explored via the construction of a latent low-dimensional space which enables convenient visualization and efficient predictive modeling or clustering. For complex data structures, linear dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA may not be sufficiently flexible to enable low-dimensional representation. Non-linear dimension reduction techniques, like kernel PCA and autoencoders, suffer from loss of interpretability since each latent variable is dependent of all input dimensions. To address this limitation, we here present path lasso penalized autoencoders. This structured regularization enhances interpretability by penalizing each path through the encoder from an input to a latent variable, thus restricting how many input variables are represented in each latent dimension. Our algorithm uses a group lasso penalty and non-negative matrix factorization to construct a sparse, non-linear latent representation. We compare the path lasso regularized autoencoder to PCA, sparse PCA, autoencoders and sparse autoencoders on real and simulated data sets. We show that the algorithm exhibits much lower reconstruction errors than sparse PCA and parameter-wise lasso regularized autoencoders for low-dimensional representations. Moreover, path lasso representations provide a more accurate reconstruction match, i.e. preserved relative distance between objects in the original and reconstructed spaces.\n"""\n\nRespond in the following format:\n\nTHOUGHT:\n<THOUGHT>\n\nRESPONSE:\n```json\n<JSON>\n```\n\nIn <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.\nIf you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.\n\nIn <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:\n- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need).
