To address this challenge, we propose an orthogonal sparse autoencoder that enforces feature separation in a simple, batch-level fashion. During each training step, our method targets only a small fraction of the most strongly co-activated feature pairs and applies an orthogonality penalty to them, preventing the merging of unrelated representations. By focusing on the most problematic interactions as they happen rather than tracking them over the entire training history, we reduce computational overhead and maintain a streamlined implementation. We assess the effectiveness of both fixed and adaptive strategies for selecting top pairs based on activations from models with up to 2 billion parameters. Our evaluation encompasses metrics that measure debiasing and the unlearning of dangerous knowledge, highlighting improvements in interpretability and reduced feature overlap without compromising reconstruction fidelity. Overall, our approach provides a flexible and efficient solution for mitigating polysemanticity while maintaining the simplicity and speed of batch-level updates, taking another step toward preventing the harmful use of state-of-the-art language models.', 'novel': True, 'NOTE': "IGNORE the benchmark 'UNLEARNING'"}]
