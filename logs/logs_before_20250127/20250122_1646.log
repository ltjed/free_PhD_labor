THOUGHT:
I propose a "Temporal Sparse Autoencoder" (TSA) that leverages sequential information in language model activations to improve feature disentanglement. The key insight is that truly distinct features should exhibit different temporal dynamics in how they activate across tokens in a sequence. For example, a feature tracking "subject of sentence" might activate strongly at the start and fade, while one tracking "verb tense" might maintain consistent activation throughout.

The core innovation is adding a temporal consistency regularizer that encourages features that tend to co-activate across sequential tokens to merge into a single feature. This directly addresses the feature absorption problem by providing an additional signal for when features should or should not be combined. Additionally, features that exhibit very different temporal patterns are encouraged to remain separate, improving disentanglement.

This approach differs from existing SAE variants by explicitly incorporating sequential structure rather than treating each activation independently. For the unlearning benchmark specifically, better disentangled features should enable more precise identification and removal of undesired knowledge.

THOUGHT:
Upon review, I see several areas for improvement in the Temporal SAE idea:

1. Feasibility concerns:
- The temporal attention mechanism adds significant computational overhead
- Processing sequences requires more memory and complicates batching
- The 30-minute runtime constraint is challenging with sequence processing

2. Novelty assessment:
- Temporal patterns in language are well-studied
- Attention mechanisms are very standard
- The innovation lies mainly in application rather than fundamental advances

3. Clarity improvements needed:
- The connection to unlearning benchmark should be more explicit
- Technical details should be more precise about implementation
- Evaluation metrics need better specification

I propose streamlining the approach by:
1. Replacing attention with a simpler sliding window correlation
2. Using fixed-size chunks instead of variable sequences
3. Adding explicit metrics for unlearning performance
4. Providing more detailed implementation specifics

This should improve feasibility while maintaining the core insight about temporal patterns aiding disentanglement.

THOUGHT:
After further analysis, I see opportunities to strengthen the idea:

1. Feasibility improvements:
- Replace correlation computation with simple difference of consecutive activations
- Pre-compute temporal statistics during data loading
- Use vectorized operations for all computations

2. Technical precision:
- Add specific hyperparameter values and initialization schemes
- Detail exact buffer sizes and memory requirements
- Specify concrete evaluation metrics

3. Unlearning benchmark focus:
- Add explicit feature categorization mechanism
- Include targeted sparsity levels for different feature types
- Provide specific success metrics for unlearning

4. Implementation simplification:
- Remove batch processing complexity
- Use static memory allocation
- Minimize code changes to existing SAE

These refinements maintain the core temporal insight while maximizing feasibility and practical impact.

THOUGHT:
The current version of Temporal SAE is strong, with a high Overall_Score of 9.5. Let's verify its strengths:

1. Feasibility (10/10):
- Uses simple temporal differences
- Minimal memory overhead
- Fast vectorized operations
- Clear implementation path
- Well within 30-minute runtime constraint

2. Novelty (9/10):
- Novel combination of temporal analysis and feature categorization
- Unique approach to unlearning
- Original differential sparsity mechanism

3. Interestingness (9/10):
- Direct connection to unlearning benchmark
- Clear theoretical motivation
- Practical utility

The implementation is maximally simplified while maintaining effectiveness. The approach is theoretically sound and practically feasible. The evaluation metrics and success criteria are well-defined. The connection to the unlearning benchmark is direct and compelling.

I don't see any significant areas for improvement that wouldn't compromise the careful balance of feasibility, novelty, and effectiveness. Adding complexity would hurt feasibility, while simplifying further would reduce effectiveness.

I am done.

The idea of using temporal stability for feature disentanglement in sparse autoencoders is interesting. I should search for any existing work that uses temporal information or sequential structure in sparse autoencoders, particularly for interpretability or knowledge removal.
