THOUGHT:
The idea proposes using Nyström approximation methods for spectral regularization in sparse autoencoders, combined with momentum-based feature resampling. The Nyström method is a well-established technique for approximating kernel matrices and eigendecompositions, but I need to check if it has been specifically applied to SAEs for mechanistic interpretability. Let me search for papers that combine Nyström methods with autoencoders or feature learning, particularly in the context of interpretability.

Let's search for papers that combine these concepts to see if this specific application is novel.

From the search results, I can see several papers using sparse autoencoders in various contexts, but none specifically combine Nyström approximation with SAEs for mechanistic interpretability. Paper #8 "Enhancing Neural Network Interpretability with Feature-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders" is the closest related work, but focuses on mutual feature regularization rather than spectral methods. Let me do one more search specifically focused on spectral methods and Nyström approximations in the context of neural network interpretability to be thorough.

THOUGHT:
After reviewing both rounds of search results, I can now make a decision. While there are papers using spectral regularization for neural networks (Paper #0 "Graph Spectral Regularization for Neural Network Interpretability") and papers on sparse autoencoders for interpretability, none combine Nyström approximation with SAEs specifically for mechanistic interpretability. The momentum-based feature resampling aspect using gradient alignments is also novel. The closest works either focus on graph-based spectral methods or traditional regularization approaches, but don't address the computational efficiency challenge of spectral methods in the way proposed. Let me do one final search specifically for Nyström methods in autoencoders to be completely thorough.

THOUGHT:
This idea proposes integrating activation sparsity statistics with randomized orthogonal decomposition in sparse autoencoders. The key novelty claim is using activation frequencies to adapt the orthogonalization constraints. I should search for papers that combine sparse autoencoders with orthogonalization, particularly any that incorporate activation statistics or similar adaptive mechanisms.

Let me search for papers about orthogonalization in sparse autoencoders and adaptive regularization based on feature usage statistics.

THOUGHT:
The idea proposes a hierarchical SAE with geometric sparsity scaling and progressive layer activation. The key novelty claims are around:
