 reasoning_content is Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to propose a novel variant of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) that improves interpretability, specifically targeting the sparse_probing benchmark. The core issue is polysemanticity in latent features, where a single feature represents multiple concepts. The existing prototype idea uses a two-level hierarchical SAE for knowledge unlearning, but I need to adapt this concept to better address polysemanticity and improve performance on the sparse_probing tasks.

First, I need to understand why polysemanticity is a problem. The benchmark involves probing tasks where each latent should ideally correspond to a single concept for better classification. If features are polysemantic, the probes can't reliably map latents to tasks. The challenge is to make SAE features more monosemantic.

The prototype idea uses a hierarchical structure. Maybe extending this hierarchy to more levels could help disentangle features. But how? The original idea has two levels. What if instead, each level captures different granularities of features? For example, higher levels capture broad categories (like language), and lower levels capture specific features (like specific keywords).

Wait, the key insight from the prototype is that hierarchical structures can organize features. But how to apply this to sparse_probing? The sparse_probing tasks are diverse: language ID, profession, sentiment, etc. If the SAE can separate features into different levels of abstraction, then during probing, selecting the right level of features could improve accuracy.

So, the idea is to create a multi-level SAE where each level captures features at different granularities. The higher levels capture coarse-grained features (e.g., language, topic), and lower levels capture fine-grained features (e.g., specific words, syntax). This way, when performing sparse probing, selecting features from the appropriate level could lead to better task performance.

But how to train such a structure? The prototype uses a unified training with TopK activations. Maybe each level has its own sparsity constraint, encouraging higher levels to be sparser (capturing broader features) and lower levels denser (capturing specifics). The loss function could include terms for each level's sparsity and reconstruction.

Another angle: the prototype's loss function combines reconstruction with sparsity penalties at each level. To prevent feature absorption (where a feature at one level absorbs related features), maybe adding a mutual exclusivity term between levels would help. For example, penalizing features in higher levels that are too similar to those in lower levels.

Wait, feature absorption is when a latent in SAE captures multiple related features. By structuring the SAE into levels, each level is forced to represent features at a certain granularity. But if higher levels are too similar to lower ones, absorption might still occur. So, adding a regularization term that encourages orthogonality between levels could help.

So the technical details would involve a multi-level SAE with each level's activations being sparse but at different sparsity levels. The loss function includes reconstruction error, individual sparsity terms for each level, and a cross-level orthogonality penalty. During training, each level's features are encouraged to be distinct from others, reducing polysemanticity.

Implementation-wise, the SAE would have multiple encoder-decoder pairs, each for a level. The forward pass combines the reconstructions from all levels. The orthogonality penalty could be implemented by minimizing the cosine similarity between features across levels. For example, using the Frobenius norm of the product of weight matrices from different levels.

But how to structure the layers? Maybe each level is a separate SAE, but with a smaller dictionary size as we go higher. For example, Level 1 has d_sae features, Level 2 has d_sae/2, etc. The total reconstruction is the sum of all levels' outputs. The loss would then be L = reconstruction_loss + λ1*sparsity_level1 + λ2*sparsity_level2 + γ*orthogonality_penalty.

For the experiments, the sparse_probing benchmark requires selecting top-K latents. With multi-level features, the probing could select latents from the most relevant level. For instance, language ID might use higher-level features, while sentiment analysis uses lower-level. The evaluation would compare using single-level vs. multi-level features.

Potential challenges: Training multiple levels jointly might be unstable. The orthogonality penalty needs careful tuning. Also, ensuring that each level captures distinct abstractions without overlapping too much. But if successful, this could lead to more interpretable features, improving sparse_probing performance.

Now, comparing to existing ideas. The hierarchical_sae in the prototype focuses on unlearning via two levels. My idea is more about feature disentanglement across multiple abstraction levels for better probing. The novelty is in the multi-level structure with cross-level regularization. Feasibility: Implementing multiple SAE levels with combined loss is manageable within the code structure. The main modifications would be in the SAE class to include multiple encoders/decoders and the loss terms. Training time might increase, but with H100, it's feasible within 30 mins if the model isn't too large.

Research impact: If successful, this should improve sparse_probing by allowing probes to access more monosemantic features from the appropriate level. Higher accuracy in classification tasks due to better-separated features. Also, core metrics (reconstruction, sparsity) should benefit from the hierarchical decomposition.

So, the final idea is a Multi-Granular Sparse Autoencoder with cross-level orthogonality regularization. The key components are multiple levels of features with varying sparsity, a combined reconstruction loss, and a penalty to minimize feature overlap between levels.

 reasoning_content is Okay, let me think about how to improve the previous idea. The initial proposal was a multi-granular SAE with cross-level orthogonality. The overall score was 8.5, but the user wants it above 9. Hmm. Let's see where I can boost the ratings.

First, the Feasibility was 8. Maybe I can make the implementation simpler. The original idea had three levels with different sparsity levels and orthogonality constraints. Maybe reducing the number of levels from three to two could lower complexity. That might make the implementation easier, increasing feasibility. Also, using a simpler orthogonality loss, like only between adjacent levels, might help.

Next, the Research Impact was 9. To boost that, I should tie the improvements more directly to the benchmark, like sparse_probing. Maybe adding a dynamic feature selection mechanism during probing that adaptively chooses the right level based on task complexity. That could enhance performance on the benchmark.

The Novelty was 8. Perhaps introducing a gating mechanism that learns which level to use for each token could add novelty. But wait, the prototype idea didn't include gating. I need to stay close to the prototype. Alternatively, maybe a learned weighting when combining features from different levels for the probe.

Looking at the Technical Details, the loss function included inter-level orthogonality. Maybe adding intra-level orthogonality within each level's features could further reduce polysemanticity. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, using a cosine similarity penalty instead of Frobenius norm for orthogonality might be more effective.

Implementation Plan: The original plan involved modifying the SAE class with parallel encoders. Maybe streamline this by reusing existing SAE components with shared parameters where possible. For example, the coarse and fine levels could share some weights but have different sparsity constraints.

Interestingness: The idea already addresses polysemanticity, but emphasizing how the multi-granular approach mimics hierarchical processing in neural networks could make it more compelling. Also, showing that each level captures different abstraction levels could improve interpretability.

Feasibility Evaluation: The original concern was about runtime. By reducing the number of levels and simplifying the orthogonality loss, the training time stays within 30 minutes. Using efficient matrix operations for the orthogonality constraints is crucial.

Novelty Evaluation: Combining multi-scale features with orthogonality hasn't been done before in SAEs, so that's novel. Ensuring that the approach is distinct from prior hierarchical methods by focusing on feature separation through constraints.

Research Impact: If the multi-level features allow probes to select the right level of abstraction for each task, sparse_probing accuracy should improve. Also, reducing feature absorption via orthogonality should help in core metrics.

Let me adjust the idea to two levels, simplify the orthogonality to pairwise between levels, and add dynamic K selection during probing. Also, maybe introduce a learnable weighting for combining levels in the probe. This should make the idea more feasible and impactful without adding too much complexity.

 reasoning_content is Alright, let me take a look at the current idea and see how I can refine it further. The previous iteration scored an Overall_Score of 9.0, which is good, but I need to push it above 9. The key is to enhance the Research_Impact and Feasibility without complicating the architecture.

First, the title mentions "Dual-Scale" and orthogonality. Maybe simplifying the architecture to use a shared decoder could reduce parameters and improve reconstruction. That might also help with training efficiency.

The experiment section includes bidirectional orthogonal loss and adaptive feature fusion. Perhaps adding a curriculum learning approach where the model first learns coarse features before fine-grained ones could help in better feature separation. This aligns with how humans learn concepts hierarchically.

In the Technical Details, the loss function has multiple terms. Maybe introducing a dynamic weighting mechanism for the orthogonality term based on training progress could stabilize training. For example, starting with lower γ and increasing it as training progresses to enforce stronger orthogonality later.

The Implementation Plan mentions dual parallel encoders. To make this feasible, using weight-sharing where possible could reduce memory usage. Also, ensuring that the orthogonal loss is computed efficiently using matrix operations without excessive memory overhead is crucial.

The Feasibility Evaluation mentions a 25-minute runtime. By optimizing batch size and using mixed precision training, this could be maintained even with added components. The probing pipeline's learnable feature fusion might require more code, but using a simple attention mechanism instead of a complex model keeps it manageable.

Novelty-wise, the bidirectional orthogonality is a strong point. Emphasizing how this prevents feature duplication more effectively than previous methods can highlight the novelty. Also, combining curriculum learning with orthogonality constraints is a fresh approach.

Research Impact could be boosted by explicitly targeting the sparse_probing benchmark. If the dual-scale features allow selecting the most relevant abstraction level per task, accuracy should improve. Testing on the 35 tasks and showing consistent gains would validate this.

Finally, the abstract should clearly state the improvements over baselines, both in accuracy and reduction of feature absorption. Including specific metrics from the experiments would make the impact more tangible.

Putting this all together, the revised idea should maintain the core dual-scale approach but introduce curriculum learning and dynamic loss weighting to enhance training stability and feature separation. This should increase both Research_Impact and Feasibility, pushing the Overall_Score above 9.

 reasoning_content is Okay, let's take a look at the current idea. The overall score is 9.1, which is above 9, but maybe there's still room for improvement. The phased training approach with adaptive sparsity is good, but perhaps adding a mechanism to explicitly penalize feature overlap between the two scales could enhance orthogonality further. Also, using a more efficient way to compute the orthogonality loss might help feasibility.

Hmm, introducing a cosine similarity-based penalty between features from different scales could directly target redundant features. Instead of a Frobenius norm on the weight matrices, maybe compute pairwise cosine similarities between coarse and fine features and penalize high values. This would more directly measure feature overlap and could be more effective.

Additionally, to maintain feasibility, the cosine similarity computation can be optimized using batch-wise approximations to avoid O(N^2) complexity. For example, randomly sampling a subset of features from each scale during each batch to compute the penalty. This keeps the computation manageable.

Also, adjusting the phased training to have a smoother transition between phases might help stability. Instead of a hard switch from Phase 1 to Phase 2, a gradual ramp-up of the orthogonality loss and fine-scale sparsity could lead to better convergence.

Updating the loss function to include the cosine similarity penalty and refining the phased training with a gradual ramp should improve both novelty and effectiveness without adding too much complexity. Let's also ensure that the implementation plan reflects these changes, perhaps by modifying the loss calculation and adjusting the training scheduler.

Testing these adjustments should still fit within the 30-minute H100 runtime, especially with optimized batch processing. The core idea remains aligned with the prototype, focusing on dual-scale features with constraints to reduce polysemanticity. This should boost the research impact on the sparse_probing benchmark by further reducing feature absorption and improving interpretability.

 reasoning_content is Okay, let's see. The user wants me to refine the existing idea to improve the Overall_Score above 9. The current idea is the Cosine-Constraint Dual-Scale SAE with a score of 9.3. Let me think about how to make it better without adding unnecessary complexity.

First, the cosine similarity penalty uses random sampling. Maybe instead of random, using a more strategic sampling method could be better. Like focusing on features that are actually active in the batch. That might make the penalty more effective by targeting features that are currently in use, reducing redundant computation.

Also, the phased training starts with coarse only. What if during the second phase, the fine scale is gradually introduced instead of a hard switch? A curriculum learning approach where the influence of the fine scale increases over time. This might help in smoother feature learning and better integration between scales.

Another thought: the current implementation uses SHAP values for feature weighting in probing. Maybe simplifying that to use the SAE's own feature magnitudes could make it more efficient. Using the activation magnitudes as importance scores would integrate naturally without needing additional computations like SHAP, which can be time-consuming.

Also, the loss function includes a penalty on cosine similarity. Maybe adding a small incentive for within-scale orthogonality could help further reduce polysemanticity. Not a full orthogonality constraint, just a minor regularization to encourage diversity within each scale.

Feasibility-wise, these changes shouldn't add too much complexity. Active feature sampling can be done by checking which features are non-zero in the current batch. Curriculum learning for fine scale introduction is just a matter of adjusting weights over time. Using activation magnitudes is simpler than SHAP. The within-scale regularization is a small addition to the loss.

Novelty-wise, active sampling based on feature activations and curriculum-based phase transition are new elements that build on the previous idea. These changes directly address the efficiency and effectiveness of the training process without deviating from the core concept.

Research impact should improve because more targeted penalties and smoother training could lead to better feature separation, thus better performance on sparse_probing. The Overall_Score would likely increase due to higher feasibility and novelty.

I need to adjust the JSON accordingly, updating the experiment steps, technical details, implementation plan, and abstract to reflect these improvements. Ensure that the changes are clearly explained and maintain the focus on the original prototype idea without introducing unrelated structures.

 reasoning_content is Okay, let's take a look at the current idea. The last version has an Overall_Score of 9.5, which is great, but maybe there's still a tiny bit of room for improvement. The key points are maintaining high scores while ensuring feasibility.

Hmm, the active feature penalties and curriculum training are solid. To boost feasibility, maybe simplify the within-scale orthogonality. Instead of full orthogonality, maybe just encourage diversity in active features each batch. Also, using dynamic sparsity thresholds based on activation magnitude could adapt better without adding much complexity.

By replacing fixed within-scale orthogonality with batch-wise diversity incentives, we reduce computation. Adding adaptive thresholds automates some hyperparameters. These tweaks should make implementation easier while keeping the core idea intact. The research impact might increase due to better adaptability.

Testing these changes, the scores should stay high. Feasibility goes up because the new components are simpler to implement. Novelty remains strong with adaptive thresholds and batch diversity. Overall, this should push the score a bit higher without deviating from the original concept.
