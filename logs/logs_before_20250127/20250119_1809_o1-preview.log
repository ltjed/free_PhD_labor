{'Name': 'contrastive_sparse_autoencoder', 'Title': 'Contrastive Sparse Autoencoders for Enhanced Unlearning in Language Models', 'Experiment': "1. Implement a contrastive loss term in the SAE training to encourage separation between 'forget' and 'retain' data in the latent space.\n2. Modify the SAE training procedure to include batches from both 'forget' and 'retain' datasets.\n3. Train the Contrastive SAE (cSAE) on activations from a language model, using both 'forget' (WMDP-bio) and 'retain' (WikiText) datasets.\n4. Evaluate the unlearning performance by following the benchmark protocol: sweep hyperparameters and measure WMDP-bio accuracy and MMLU accuracy.\n5. Compare the unlearning effectiveness of cSAE with the baseline SAE by analyzing the minimum achieved WMDP-bio accuracy while maintaining MMLU accuracy above 0.99.\n6. Analyze the interpretability of the learned features to verify that cSAE produces more distinct and monosemantic features related to the 'forget' dataset.", 'Technical_Details': "The Contrastive Sparse Autoencoder (cSAE) extends the standard SAE by incorporating a contrastive loss that encourages the latent representations of 'forget' and 'retain' data to be distinct. The training procedure involves:\n\n- For each batch, sample equal numbers of activations from the 'forget' dataset (WMDP-bio) and the 'retain' dataset (WikiText).\n- Compute the standard reconstruction loss (e.g., mean squared error) for both 'forget' and 'retain' activations.\n- Compute the contrastive loss by measuring the similarity between latent representations: minimize the similarity between 'forget' and 'retain' latent activations.\n- The total loss is the sum of reconstruction loss and a weighted contrastive loss term.\n- Use a sparsity-inducing activation function (e.g., ReLU or TopK) to maintain sparse latent activations.\n\nThe contrastive loss can be implemented using a loss function such as the cosine embedding loss or triplet loss. The choice of loss function and weighting coefficient are hyperparameters to be tuned.\n\nBy training the cSAE in this way, the model learns latent features that are more specific to the 'forget' data, improving the ability to identify and manipulate those features during unlearning.", 'Research_Impact': "A key challenge in mechanistic interpretability, especially in the context of unlearning, is polysemanticity, where features represent multiple concepts, making it difficult to selectively remove knowledge. The proposed cSAE addresses this challenge by incorporating contrastive learning to encourage the latent representations of 'forget' and 'retain' data to be distinct and monosemantic. This enhances the interpretability of the learned features and improves the effectiveness of unlearning by making it easier to identify and manipulate features associated with unwanted knowledge, while preserving unrelated capabilities.", 'Implementation_Plan': "1. Modify the CustomTrainer class in experiment.py to include a contrastive loss component in the training loop.\n\n- Sample batches containing activations from both 'forget' (WMDP-bio) and 'retain' (WikiText) datasets.\n- Implement a contrastive loss function (e.g., cosine embedding loss) between the latent activations of 'forget' and 'retain' data.\n- Adjust the loss computation to include the contrastive loss term with an appropriate weighting coefficient.\n\n2. Adjust the data loading pipeline to provide activations from both datasets in each batch.\n\n3. Tune the weighting coefficient for the contrastive loss term to balance reconstruction and separation.\n\n4. Ensure that the training process remains efficient and within resource constraints (training time under 30 minutes on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU).\n\n5. After training, evaluate the cSAE using the unlearning benchmark, following the specified procedure.\n\n6. Compare results with the baseline SAE and analyze the interpretability of the learned features.", 'Interestingness_Evaluation': 'The idea is interesting because it applies contrastive learning within the SAE framework to directly address polysemanticity, improving unlearning performance by enhancing feature disentanglement.', 'Interestingness': 8, 'Feasibility_Evaluation': 'The implementation is feasible within the time and resource constraints: modifying the training loop to add a contrastive loss is straightforward, and training should remain efficient.', 'Feasibility': 8, 'Novelty_Evaluation': 'The application of contrastive learning to SAEs for mechanistic interpretability and unlearning is a novel approach not covered in existing ideas.', 'Novelty': 8, 'Overall_Score': 8.0}
