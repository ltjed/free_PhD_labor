THOUGHT:
The prototype idea introduces temporal modeling which adds significant complexity and may not directly address the core challenges of interpretability. Instead, I propose refining the idea to focus on hierarchical feature learning through nested dictionaries (Matryoshka-style), which maintains the spirit of temporal dependencies but in a simpler, more interpretable way.

The key insight is that by explicitly organizing features hierarchically during training, we can better capture natural abstractions and reduce feature absorption. Rather than tracking temporal correlations, we use nested reconstruction losses where smaller dictionaries must learn the most important features first. This encourages the model to discover natural hierarchies in the data while maintaining simplicity.

The modification should improve mechanistic interpretability because:
1. Hierarchical organization naturally aligns with how humans understand concepts
2. Forces the model to learn progressively more specific features rather than arbitrary combinations
3. Maintains mathematical simplicity while addressing feature absorption
4. Requires minimal changes to existing architecture
5. Directly targets the sparse probing benchmark by encouraging more interpretable feature organization

The approach refines the prototype by:
- Replacing temporal tracking with hierarchical nesting (simpler)
- Using standard reconstruction loss instead of correlation matrices
- Keeping the same basic SAE architecture
- Focusing on feature organization rather than intervention strategies

THOUGHT: Let me elaborate on why this specific approach should improve mechanistic interpretability:

1. The hierarchical structure naturally encourages more interpretable feature extraction by forcing the model to learn progressively more specific features. This directly addresses the polysemanticity issue highlighted in the background paper.

2. By having multiple nested dictionaries, we create implicit pressure for features to organize themselves in a meaningful hierarchy - broad patterns must be captured in the smaller dictionaries while specific details are left to the larger ones.

3. The approach maintains mathematical and architectural simplicity while still providing a principled way to encourage better feature organization.
