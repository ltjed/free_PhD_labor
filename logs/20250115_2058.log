This research addresses these challenges through three key innovations: First, the shared encoder architecture with separate heads improves training stability and efficiency. Second, the curriculum learning approach helps discover meaningful primitive features before learning compositions. Third, the causal tracing mechanism enables more precise unlearning interventions. Together, these improvements enable better performance on the WMDP-bio benchmark while maintaining model capabilities on safe tasks.', 'Proto-Experiments': '1.

This makes it possible to more precisely target dangerous knowledge while preserving safe capabilities. The approach also provides better interpretability by revealing actual causal paths rather than just correlations.', 'Proto-Experiments': '1.
