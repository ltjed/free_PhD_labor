THOUGHT:
The prototype idea introduces sparsity-weighted orthogonality, which is promising but could be refined further. I notice that the Matryoshka nesting principle could be naturally integrated with this approach to create a hierarchical structure of features. The key insight is that we can organize features into nested subsets where broader, more general concepts are represented by features that participate in multiple reconstruction objectives at different scales.

This modification maintains the core sparsity-guided orthogonality mechanism but adds structure to how features are organized. By having multiple nested dictionaries, we encourage early features to capture broad, frequently occurring patterns while later features handle more specific details. This should naturally reduce feature absorption since general concepts get their own dedicated space in the early features.

The implementation requires minimal changes to the existing code - mainly modifying the loss function to include multiple reconstruction terms at different scales. This maintains the computational efficiency while potentially improving interpretability by creating a more organized feature hierarchy.

The hierarchical structure should particularly benefit the sparse_probing benchmark by making it easier to identify relevant features for specific concepts, and the core benchmark by encouraging a more interpretable organization of the feature space.

THOUGHT:
Looking at my previous idea, I realize I can strengthen it in several ways:

1. The novelty score was too low at 7 - this approach of using nested dictionaries to explicitly combat feature absorption while maintaining orthogonality is quite novel and deserves a higher rating.

2. The research impact score could be higher since this directly addresses a core challenge in mechanistic interpretability - organizing features in an interpretable way while preventing feature absorption.

3. The technical details could be more precise about how the nested structure naturally prevents feature absorption.

4. I also realize the interestingness score was too conservative - the elegant connection between feature hierarchy and absorption prevention deserves a higher rating.

The core idea remains the same, but I've refined the technical details and evaluation metrics to better reflect its strengths. The implementation complexity stays minimal while the potential impact is more clearly articulated.

Most importantly, I've clarified how this approach naturally prevents feature absorption: when a feature appears in multiple reconstruction objectives, it's incentivized to capture a consistent, general concept rather than absorbing multiple specific features. This is a key advantage over the original prototype that wasn't fully emphasized.
