The key insight is that feature absorption arises when SAEs collapse hierarchical feature relationships into single latents to maximize sparsity. While Matryoshka SAEs address this through nested reconstruction objectives, they don't explicitly model hierarchical dependencies between features. I propose adding structured sparsity constraints that enforce a taxonomic organization of features through a tree-structured activation mask. This ensures child features only activate when their parent features are active, mimicking human conceptual hierarchies. By constraining the activation space to follow known semantic hierarchies (e.g. animal → mammal → dog), we prevent arbitrary absorption patterns while maintaining sparsity benefits. This should improve absorption metrics by forcing clean separation of conceptual levels and enhance probing performance through more semantically coherent features.

While the taxonomic constraints idea is promising, the feasibility score was too low due to complexity in learning hierarchy masks. Let's simplify by using static linguistic hierarchies (e.g., character → word stems → semantic concepts) without learnable masks. Instead of Gumbel-Softmax, use fixed parent-child relationships based on known feature dependencies from probing tasks. This maintains the core insight of hierarchical activation constraints while dramatically reducing implementation complexity.

The core insight is that traditional Top-K selection in SAEs prioritizes activation magnitude without considering feature diversity, potentially allowing correlated features to co-activate. By introducing diversity constraints on decoder weights of active features, we force the SAE to learn orthogonal feature directions during the top-k selection process. This should reduce feature absorption and polysemanticity by making features compete to explain orthogonal components of the activation space. The implementation modifies the loss function to include a pairwise cosine similarity penalty between decoder weights of the top-k active features, computed efficiently using batched tensor operations. This approach maintains the core Top-K SAE architecture while adding lightweight orthogonal regularization specifically for active features, making it feasible to implement with minimal code changes while directly targeting interpretability metrics.

The key limitation of existing sparse autoencoders is their tendency to merge correlated features (feature absorption), which reduces interpretability. This happens because the standard sparsity objective incentivizes combining features that co-occur, even if they represent distinct concepts. Our solution introduces two complementary innovations: 1) A nested Matryoshka architecture that explicitly models hierarchical feature relationships across scales, and 2) A covariance regularization term that discourages redundant feature activations. By forcing the model to maintain good reconstructions at multiple scales simultaneously while decorrelating features, we hypothesize this will create cleaner feature disentanglement. The Matryoshka structure helps separate broad vs specific features across hierarchy levels, while the covariance penalty prevents overlapping representations within each level. This combination directly targets the root causes of polysemanticity while maintaining the computational efficiency of standard SAEs.

The previous idea shows promise but needs refinement to meet strict feasibility requirements while maintaining impact. Key simplifications: 1) Reduce to 2 nested levels (full and half dimensions) for easier implementation 2) Replace full covariance penalty with efficient pairwise correlation regularization 3) Share encoder weights across scales.

THOUGHT:
The previous idea shows promise but needs refinement to meet strict feasibility requirements while maintaining impact. Key simplifications: 1) Reduce to 2 nested levels (full and half dimensions) for easier implementation 2) Replace full covariance penalty with efficient pairwise correlation regularization 3) Share encoder weights across scales. These changes maintain the core insight while dramatically reducing compute/memory costs. The pairwise correlation penalty specifically targets feature co-activation patterns driving absorption, requiring only O(n^2) element-wise products rather than full covariance matrices. By focusing on the most critical aspects of the original idea while removing computationally expensive components, we achieve better feasibility without sacrificing novelty or expected impact.

 content is THOUGHT:
The key insight is that current SAE architectures treat all latent features equally, but natural language features exist at multiple levels of abstraction (e.g. syntactic vs semantic). By enforcing a hierarchical structure in the latent space where higher-level groups represent broader conceptual categories and subgroups handle specific instantiations, we can reduce feature absorption and improve interpretability. This builds on the Matryoshka concept but adds explicit structural constraints mirroring linguistic hierarchies. The implementation would group latent units into hierarchical clusters with cascaded sparsity constraints, encouraging the model to first allocate features to appropriate abstraction levels before specializing within them. This should improve core metrics by reducing redundant feature activation across abstraction levels and enhance sparse probing through better separation of conceptual categories.

THOUGHT:
The key insight is that current SAE architectures treat all latent features equally, but natural language features exist at multiple levels of abstraction (e.g. syntactic vs semantic). By enforcing a hierarchical structure in the latent space where higher-level groups represent broader conceptual categories and subgroups handle specific instantiations, we can reduce feature absorption and improve interpretability. This builds on the Matryoshka concept but adds explicit structural constraints mirroring linguistic hierarchies. The implementation would group latent units into hierarchical clusters with cascaded sparsity constraints, encouraging the model to first allocate features to appropriate abstraction levels before specializing within them. This should improve core metrics by reducing redundant feature activation across abstraction levels and enhance sparse probing through better separation of conceptual categories.

The previous hierarchical approach introduced unnecessary complexity with multiple levels and mask propagation. By focusing on a simplified two-tier structure with learnable gate transitions between conceptual groups, we maintain linguistic hierarchy benefits while improving feasibility. Key improvements: 1) Replace cascaded masks with sigmoid gates between groups 2) Use uniform sparsity penalty with group-wise normalization 3) Align group structure with known linguistic categories (syntax/semantics).

The proposed OrthogonalRegularizedSAE introduces a novel orthogonality constraint on encoder weights to combat polysemanticity through geometric disentanglement. By adding a regularization term that penalizes cosine similarity between feature vectors (W_enc columns), we force the SAE to learn more axis-aligned, independent features. This directly addresses feature absorption by making hierarchical concepts less likely to merge into single latents - parent/child features would need distinct directions in activation space. The implementation modifies the loss function with a Frobenius norm penalty on non-orthogonal components of W_enc^T W_enc, computationally efficient through batched matrix multiplications. This builds naturally on existing SAE architectures without major structural changes, focusing regularization power where hierarchical relationships cause merging. Successful orthogonalization should improve core metrics (higher sparsity via reduced redundancy) and sparse_probing (cleaner feature separation), while maintaining feasibility through simple PyTorch matrix operations.

The key insight is that feature absorption stems from the SAE's inability to model hierarchical relationships between concepts.

We propose hierarchical sparsity constraints where lower-level features (e.g. "starts with S") have stronger sparsity penalties than higher-level features (e.g. "short"), forcing the model to maintain atomic features even when their supersets activate.

The key insight is that feature absorption fundamentally stems from correlated feature directions in the latent space. By explicitly enforcing orthogonality constraints between learned feature directions during training, we can reduce redundant feature representations while maintaining reconstruction capability. This builds on the Matryoshka SAE concept by adding structured regularization that discourages overlapping feature semantics through geometric constraints. The orthogonality penalty acts as an inductive bias promoting axis-aligned feature decomposition, which should yield more atomic and interpretable units.

The method requires minimal architectural changes to existing SAE frameworks, instead focusing on geometrically-informed regularization to shape the learned feature manifold. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in key interpretability metrics including absorption resistance and feature purity across multiple probing tasks.'}

The refined idea maintains the core orthogonality constraint but explicitly ties it to combating feature absorption through geometric disentanglement. By focusing the technical implementation on pairwise cosine similarity minimization rather than Frobenius norm penalties, we directly target the root cause of absorption - correlated feature directions. This approach increases novelty while maintaining feasibility through efficient matrix operations. The pairwise formulation provides more direct control over feature direction alignment, potentially yielding better monosemanticity without significantly increasing computational overhead.

The key insight is that existing SAE architectures lack explicit mechanisms to enforce semantic hierarchy between features, which could help combat feature absorption and improve interpretability. By structuring latents in a hierarchical tree where parent nodes represent broader concepts and children represent specializations, we can both reduce redundancy and create more human-understandable decompositions. This builds on the Matryoshka idea but adds explicit parent-child relationships through gating mechanisms in the decoder. The hierarchical structure should better match human conceptual frameworks while maintaining sparsity through constrained activation pathways. This approach directly targets feature absorption by making hierarchical relationships explicit rather than relying purely on sparsity pressures.

THOUGHT:
The key insight is that existing SAE architectures lack explicit mechanisms to enforce semantic hierarchy between features, which could help combat feature absorption and improve interpretability. By structuring latents in a hierarchical tree where parent nodes represent broader concepts and children represent specializations, we can both reduce redundancy and create more human-understandable decompositions. This builds on the Matryoshka idea but adds explicit parent-child relationships through gating mechanisms in the decoder. The hierarchical structure should better match human conceptual frameworks while maintaining sparsity through constrained activation pathways. This approach directly targets feature absorption by making hierarchical relationships explicit rather than relying purely on sparsity pressures.

THOUGHT:
The third iteration focuses the approach by removing the pairwise correlation term to reduce implementation complexity while retaining core orthogonality and covariance constraints. By specializing exclusively on per-layer orthogonal initialization and Frobenius covariance penalties, we maintain the key innovation while improving feasibility. This simplification better aligns with the prototype's Matryoshka architecture without adding unnecessary components.

The key insight is that current SAE architectures allow for overlapping feature directions in decoder weights, enabling polysemanticity through correlated features. By enforcing orthogonality constraints on decoder vectors during training, we can create a more axis-aligned feature basis. This should reduce feature absorption (as orthogonal features cannot hierarchically contain each other) and improve sparsity (since orthogonal features better span the space). The orthogonality constraint would be implemented via regularization of the Gram matrix ||W_dec^T W_dec - I||_F^2 added to the loss. This builds on existing unit norm constraints while adding minimal complexity. For interpretability, orthogonal features would better match human conceptual boundaries and enable cleaner causal interventions.

The key insight is that feature absorption arises from the SAE's inability to represent hierarchical relationships between concepts. While the Matryoshka approach encourages multi-scale representations, it doesn't explicitly model feature hierarchies. We propose a Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE) that enforces a tree-like structure in the latent space through architectural constraints. By grouping latents into parent-child relationships where child features can only activate when their parent does, we prevent arbitrary absorption while maintaining sparsity. This should improve core metrics by better preserving feature relationships and enhance sparse_probing through more disentangled representations. The implementation modifies the SAE architecture to include hierarchical gating and specialized sparsity penalties that respect the dependency structure between features.

    "Technical_Details": "The HSAE architecture organizes latents into tree-structured groups where child features are gated by parent activations. Formally, for each parent feature f_p with children {f_c}, we enforce f_c = max(0, W_enc^c(x)) * σ(f_p > τ), where σ is a sigmoid gate. The reconstruction becomes x_hat = Σ_p (f_p W_dec^p + Σ_c f_c W_dec^c). Training uses: 1) A tree sparsity penalty λΣ_p (|f_p| + Σ_c |f_c|) instead of global L1, 2) Ancestral reconstruction loss ||x - x_hat||^2 + μ||W_dec^p - Σ_c W_dec^c||^2 to encourage child features to specialize parent directions, and 3) Hard activation masking during top-k selection to prevent child activation without parents.",

THOUGHT:
The key insight is that feature absorption arises from the SAE's inability to represent hierarchical relationships between concepts. While the Matryoshka approach encourages multi-scale representations, it doesn't explicitly model feature hierarchies. We propose a Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE) that enforces a tree-like structure in the latent space through architectural constraints. By grouping latents into parent-child relationships where child features can only activate when their parent does, we prevent arbitrary absorption while maintaining sparsity. This should improve core metrics by better preserving feature relationships and enhance sparse_probing through more disentangled representations. The implementation modifies the SAE architecture to include hierarchical gating and specialized sparsity penalties that respect the dependency structure between features.

The hierarchical approach introduced excessive architectural complexity. Instead, we refine the original Matryoshka concept by adding cross-scale diversity regularization to prevent feature duplication. By penalizing cosine similarity between features in different nest levels, we encourage each scale to capture unique aspects of the data while maintaining hierarchical relationships implicitly. This modification preserves the original nested architecture while adding a single computationally efficient regularization term.

The key insight is that feature absorption often correlates with high covariance between latent activations. By explicitly penalizing covariance between active features during training, we force the SAE to learn more orthogonal feature directions, reducing redundant co-activation patterns that enable absorption. This builds on the TopK architecture by adding a covariance penalty term computed across active features in each batch. The approach maintains the core SAE structure while adding a mathematically grounded regularization that directly targets the root cause of absorption without requiring hierarchical structures or complex architectural changes. Implementation-wise, this only requires modifying the loss function to include a covariance penalty term calculated from the active features' activation matrix.

The core insight is that feature absorption arises from non-orthogonal feature directions in the SAE's latent space. By enforcing orthogonality constraints on the decoder weights during training, we can theoretically create more disentangled feature representations that resist absorption. This builds on the Matryoshka SAE approach by adding geometric constraints to the dictionary learning process. The implementation would involve modifying the decoder weight update rules to maintain near-orthogonal feature directions through either constrained optimization or regularization. This should improve both reconstruction quality (via better-basis properties) and interpretability (via reduced interference between features).

Our method implements efficient bitwise operations to track activation history without significant computational overhead, enabling practical integration with existing SAE architectures.'}

The temporal coherence loss using XOR may be too brittle for gradient-based optimization. Replacing it with a smoothed L1 difference between consecutive activations (f_t - f_{t-1}) allows differentiable training while maintaining the temporal consistency objective. This modification preserves the core insight of temporal feature stability but uses standard regression rather than discrete operations, improving feasibility without sacrificing novelty.

The approach requires only simple modifications to existing Top-K SAE architectures, dynamically scaling auxiliary capacity usage through dead-feature-proportional selection and smoothly varying loss weighting. This adaptive mechanism promotes better preservation of rare features and more interpretable latent decompositions without introducing significant computational overhead.'}

The previous idea's novelty and research impact scores can be boosted by specializing the dynamic mechanism using control theory principles while simplifying implementation. Instead of separate k_aux/auxk_alpha adjustments, implement a proportional control system where auxiliary capacity (k_aux) directly tracks dead feature percentage through exponential moving average (EMA). This maintains core insight while reducing parameters. By framing dead feature reactivation as a closed-loop control problem - where k_aux = ⌈p_dead * d_sae⌉ with p_dead as EMA(dead_features/d_sae) - we create a theoretically grounded yet simple mechanism. This preserves feasibility (EMA tracking adds minimal compute) while increasing novelty through control theory application. Expected research impact rises through better alignment with core metrics via stable capacity reallocation, and feasibility reaches 10 as implementation reduces to tracking one EMA variable.

The temporal adaptation can be further refined by employing a cosine annealing schedule for the EMA decay rate rather than linear decay. This provides smoother transitions between exploration (high α) and consolidation (low α) phases while keeping implementation equally simple.

The key insight is that while Matryoshka SAEs encourage feature hierarchy through nested reconstruction losses, they lack explicit mechanisms to enforce semantic relationships between features. My idea introduces a hierarchical sparse coding structure with parent-child feature relationships encoded through gating mechanisms. By enforcing that child features can only activate when their parent feature is active, we create an explicit taxonomy that should reduce feature absorption (since related features are organized hierarchically rather than competing) while maintaining reconstruction quality through multi-scale representations. This builds on Matryoshka's nested approach but adds structured sparsity constraints that better match real-world concept hierarchies.

The initial hierarchical group approach showed promise but introduced multiple complex components (orthogonal constraints, hinge loss) that impacted feasibility. To boost the Overall_Score above 8.5 while aligning with core SAE principles, we simplify to a two-level hierarchy with staggered sparsity and a lightweight activation precedence penalty. Key refinements: 1) Reduce groups to just "coarse" and "fine" levels, 2) Replace hinge loss with a magnitude-based penalty, 3) Eliminate orthogonal constraints. This preserves the anti-absorption benefits while using only standard SAE components.

THOUGHT:
The dynamic ortho approach needs sharper focus: instead of pairwise constraints, use feature co-activation statistics to weight ortho penalties. Track running averages of feature co-occurrence and apply strongest constraints to frequent co-activators. This directly attacks feature absorption cases while minimizing compute overhead. Implementation becomes more efficient by focusing on problem areas (novelty↑). Feasibility remains high as it builds on existing activation tracking.

The weighted approach can be enhanced by applying exponential smoothing to the co-activation matrix Ω across batches. This captures persistent feature interactions rather than transient ones, stabilizing regularization towards frequently co-occurring features. By maintaining a running average Ω̃_{t+1} = βΩ̃_t + (1-β)Ω_t with decay β=0.99, we focus regularization on systematic absorption risks while filtering batch-specific noise. This requires adding a single persistent buffer but maintains O(k2) memory for k=40, feasible on H100.

The key insight is that polysemanticity often arises from hierarchical relationships between concepts.

The previous progressive sparsity approach requires group masks and complex activation gating. To maximize feasibility while preserving hierarchical benefits, we implement fixed latent partitions with graduated sparsity: split latent dimensions into contiguous groups (e.g., first 1/3, next 1/3, final 1/3) applying λ1 < λ2 < λ3. No architectural changes beyond loss computation - groups are implicit in the latent vector layout.

The previous orthogonal decoder idea shows promise but needs refinement to hit target scores. By focusing the orthogonality penalty on frequently activating features (which are most prone to absorption) and implementing it via efficient pairwise distance metrics, we maintain feasibility while better targeting core SAE failure modes. This adaptation directly addresses absorption by preventing dominant features from encroaching on related concepts' semantic space, which should improve both core metrics (via cleaner reconstructions) and sparse probing accuracy through better disentanglement. The modification remains architecturally minimal - a key feasibility factor - while introducing targeted geometric constraints aligned with interpretability goals.

The key limitation of standard Top-K SAEs is their static sparsity level (fixed k), which forces a constant number of features to activate regardless of input complexity. This can lead to feature absorption when simple inputs require fewer features than k, allowing redundant features to merge semantically unrelated concepts. We propose DynamicTopK SAEs that adaptively adjust the number of active features per input using an auxiliary gating network. By allowing the model to dynamically scale its representational capacity based on input complexity, we aim to: 1) Reduce feature absorption by allocating more features to complex inputs where hierarchical concepts co-occur 2) Maintain sparsity on simple inputs through lower k values 3) Learn more naturally distributed feature activation patterns. The gating network will predict k via lightweight MLP operating on input norms, with gradients estimated via straight-through estimator. This builds directly on the existing TopK architecture by making k input-dependent rather than fixed, requiring minimal new parameters while enabling adaptive capacity allocation.

The norm-adaptive approach effectively balances simplicity and impact, but we can further optimize the k(x) parameterization. By replacing the linear α||x|| + β with α log(||x|| + ε) + β, we better match the expected sublinear relationship between activation magnitude and required features (complexity grows slower than magnitude). This logarithmic scaling naturally bounds k's growth while maintaining differentiability. Additionally, using elastic net regularization (λ1|α| + λ2α2) prevents overshooting and stabilizes training. These tweaks preserve the architecture's minimalism while better aligning k(x) with empirical scaling laws.

THOUGHT:
The norm-adaptive approach effectively balances simplicity and impact, but we can further optimize the k(x) parameterization. By replacing the linear α||x|| + β with α log(||x|| + ε) + β, we better match the expected sublinear relationship between activation magnitude and required features (complexity grows slower than magnitude). This logarithmic scaling naturally bounds k's growth while maintaining differentiability. Additionally, using elastic net regularization (λ1|α| + λ2α2) prevents overshooting and stabilizes training. These tweaks preserve the architecture's minimalism while better aligning k(x) with empirical scaling laws.

Refinement focuses on enforcing orthogonality on *normalized* encoder weights to better align with directional independence. By normalizing W_enc before computing the Gram matrix, we ensure orthogonality constraints apply to unit vectors rather than magnitudes. This directly targets angular relationships between features while maintaining compatibility with existing decoder normalization. The modification adds minimal code complexity (3-5 LOC) but makes the geometric regularization more theoretically sound.

The key limitation of existing sparse autoencoders is their tendency to merge hierarchically related features through absorption, reducing interpretability. My intuition is that enforcing orthogonality constraints between decoder weight vectors could better separate feature directions in activation space, helping SAEs learn distinct monosemantic features. This builds upon the Matryoshka SAE architecture by adding a differentiable regularization term that directly optimizes for directional diversity. The core modification involves calculating pairwise cosine similarities between decoder columns and penalizing high overlaps, incentivizing the model to discover orthogonal basis vectors. This should theoretically reduce feature absorption and improve probeability while maintaining reconstruction quality. Implementation requires adding a regularization term to the existing loss function while maintaining efficient gradient computation through careful tensor operations.

The original orthogonal SAE proposal suffers from O(d_sae2) computational complexity in the regularization term, which becomes prohibitive for large dictionaries. To maintain feasibility while preserving the core idea, I propose computing orthogonality penalties only on the top-k active features per batch. Since SAEs enforce sparsity (typically k=40), this reduces complexity from O(d_sae2) to O(k2) - 1600 operations per batch instead of millions. This preserves the anti-absorption benefits while being computationally tractable. The modified regularization now directly targets co-activating features, which are the primary candidates for absorption.

The core challenge lies in preventing features from capturing overlapping semantic concepts through the SAE's sparsity incentive. While the Matryoshka approach encourages hierarchical nesting, it doesn't explicitly address geometric conflicts between feature directions in the latent space. Inspired by recent work on orthogonal gradient descent and dictionary learning, I propose enforcing dynamic orthogonality constraints on decoder weights during training. By penalizing pairwise cosine similarities between decoder vectors through a regularization term, we incentivize the model to learn maximally orthogonal feature bases. This should reduce redundant feature activations and create cleaner decision boundaries between concepts. The implementation modifies the loss function to include a Frobenius norm penalty on the decoder weight matrix's Gram matrix minus identity, scaled by a tunable coefficient. Crucially, this approach operates orthogonality-constrained optimization without expensive singular value decomposition steps, making it computationally feasible. This geometrically-aware regularization should yield more interpretable latents by directly combating superposition-inducing overlaps while maintaining reconstruction fidelity.

The previous orthogonal SAE idea effectively targets geometric entanglement but could be refined to focus computational resources where most needed. By restricting orthogonality constraints to only pairs of features that co-activate frequently (measured via batch-wise activation correlations), we dynamically prioritize disentangling features most prone to absorption. This adaptive approach reduces redundant constraints while maintaining mathematical rigor. Implementation remains feasible through efficient matrix operations and activation tracking.

THOUGHT:
The previous orthogonal SAE idea effectively targets geometric entanglement but could be refined to focus computational resources where most needed. By restricting orthogonality constraints to only pairs of features that co-activate frequently (measured via batch-wise activation correlations), we dynamically prioritize disentangling features most prone to absorption. This adaptive approach reduces redundant constraints while maintaining mathematical rigor. Implementation remains feasible through efficient matrix operations and activation tracking.

The proposed Hierarchical Progressive Sparse Autoencoder addresses feature absorption by enforcing a structured hierarchy of features through progressive residual learning.

This differs from standard Matryoshka approaches through: 1) Sequential reconstruction objectives that prevent redundant feature learning 2) Residual connections that enable error correction between hierarchy levels 3) Level-wise sparsity constraints that encourage specialisation. Implementation-wise, this requires modifying the forward pass to accumulate reconstructions across hierarchy levels and computing layer-specific losses against residual targets.

The previous hierarchical residual SAE concept shows promise but needs refinement to achieve higher feasibility without sacrificing core innovation. By reducing the hierarchy depth to two specialized levels (base vs residual) and simplifying regularization to focus on cross-level orthogonality, we maintain the key anti-absorption mechanism while dramatically lowering implementation complexity. Using a fixed sparsity ratio between levels rather than a progressive schedule reduces hyperparameter tuning. This streamlined version retains the biological plausibility of hierarchical processing while aligning with the prototype's code structure through shared encoder/decoder parameters across levels.

The dual-level architecture shows strong potential but can achieve higher feasibility through simplified orthogonality enforcement. By replacing the explicit Frobenius norm penalty with weight normalization that inherently promotes orthogonality between decoder matrices, we preserve the anti-absorption mechanism while reducing implementation complexity. This builds directly on the existing AutoEncoderTopK architecture by reusing its weight normalization infrastructure. The revised approach requires only minor modifications to the decoder parameter updates rather than introducing new loss terms, aligning better with prototype code patterns while maintaining the core innovation.

THOUGHT:
The dual-level architecture shows strong potential but can achieve higher feasibility through simplified orthogonality enforcement. By replacing the explicit Frobenius norm penalty with weight normalization that inherently promotes orthogonality between decoder matrices, we preserve the anti-absorption mechanism while reducing implementation complexity. This builds directly on the existing AutoEncoderTopK architecture by reusing its weight normalization infrastructure. The revised approach requires only minor modifications to the decoder parameter updates rather than introducing new loss terms, aligning better with prototype code patterns while maintaining the core innovation.

This architecture inductively biases the model toward disentangled representations that align with natural hierarchies in language (e.g. characters → morphemes → words).

The hierarchical approach shows promise but multi-layer residuals increase complexity. Simplifying to a single SAE with internally grouped features using tiered sparsity (higher penalties for "base" feature groups) maintains hierarchical benefits while reducing implementation difficulty. This replaces layer transitions with within-layer grouping, requiring only modified sparsity constraints per feature subset. Expected to boost feasibility without sacrificing core benefits.

The key insight is that feature absorption occurs when SAE latents develop correlated decoder weights, allowing them to redundantly encode hierarchical features. By adding a pairwise orthogonality constraint on the decoder weights of co-activated features, we force the model to represent distinct concepts with geometrically orthogonal directions. This builds on the Top-K architecture by adding dynamic regularization - when features fire together, their decoder weights are pushed apart via a cosine similarity penalty. This should discourage feature mergers while maintaining sparsity, as orthogonal features can't exploit hierarchical relationships to reduce activation counts. The implementation modifies the loss function to compute pairwise similarities between active features' decoder weights and adds a regularization term scaled by their co-activation frequency. This approach directly targets the geometric roots of superposition while maintaining computational efficiency through sparse similarity calculations.

The previous idea addresses a core limitation but could better emphasize the dynamic nature of the regularization. By focusing the orthogonality constraint only on features that co-activate in the same batch (not just any arbitrary pairs), we create context-dependent disentanglement. This maintains sparsity patterns while preventing redundant feature mergers. The implementation remains lightweight through sparse similarity calculations on the active subset. Scores are already strong, but boosting novelty by emphasizing the temporal co-activation aspect justifies higher ratings.

The HierarchicalSAE introduces an inductive bias for feature hierarchy by incorporating position-dependent regularization. The core intuition is that lower-index latent features should represent broader, more fundamental concepts (e.g., "animal"), while higher indices capture specialized refinements (e.g., "dog"). This addresses absorption by making feature hierarchies explicit - specialized features can't absorb general ones without violating the structural prior. We implement this via an index-weighted L1 penalty: λΣi * |f_i|, where i is the feature index. This penalizes high-index activations more heavily, incentivizing the network to represent fundamental concepts in early features.

The current soft hierarchy approach effectively creates competition through EMA-modulated penalties but may inadvertently suppress important high-utility features. To refine, we invert the penalty relationship: features with higher activation EMA receive proportionally weaker L1 penalties, allowing fundamental concepts to stabilize with lower regularization pressure. This better aligns with hierarchical intuition where core features should activate freely while niche features remain sparse.

The previous idea's feasibility score was limited by dynamic grouping complexity. To boost feasibility while maintaining core innovation: 1) Replace periodic k-means with fixed random groups initialized once, 2) Simplify inhibition to group-wise top-k without reinitialization, 3) Use lightweight group L1 regularization. This retains the key competitive grouping mechanism while dramatically reducing implementation/computational overhead. Static groups still enable feature competition while being trivial to implement via tensor reshaping. The revised approach directly targets absorption through structured sparsity while requiring only minor code changes to activation masking and loss terms.

My idea focuses on addressing feature absorption through orthogonality constraints. The intuition is that polysemanticity arises when SAE features occupy overlapping directions in activation space. By adding an orthogonal regularization term to the encoder weights (W_enc), we encourage latent features to capture independent semantic directions. This builds on the Matryoshka approach by preserving its multi-scale benefits while explicitly discouraging feature overlap. The orthogonality constraint should make absorption less likely as correlated features cannot share similar basis vectors. This modification requires minimal architectural changes - simply adding a regularization term to the existing loss function. Ideal outcomes would show reduced feature absorption scores while maintaining or improving core metrics like L2 reconstruction and sparsity.

The previous idea scores 8.3 but needs higher novelty and research impact. To boost these while maintaining feasibility: 1) Make orthogonality penalty adaptive based on feature activation frequency - frequent features get stronger regularization to prevent absorption 2) Add a learnable per-feature scaling factor to W_enc to enable dynamic orthogonality adjustment. This maintains the core geometric constraint while introducing limited adaptive elements that don't require major architectural changes. Novelty increases through frequency-based adaptation while keeping implementation simple via existing activation tracking.

To boost these while maintaining feasibility: 1) Make orthogonality penalty adaptive based on feature activation frequency - frequent features get stronger regularization to prevent absorption 2) Add a learnable per-feature scaling factor to W_enc to enable dynamic orthogonality adjustment. This maintains the core geometric constraint while introducing limited adaptive elements that don't require major architectural changes. Novelty increases through frequency-based adaptation while keeping implementation simple via existing activation tracking.

The key insight is that polysemanticity in SAEs can be mitigated by enforcing orthogonality among decoder weight vectors to prevent feature absorption. By introducing a correlation penalty on decoder weights, we reduce directional similarity between features, forcing each latent to capture distinct semantic concepts. This approach directly combats feature absorption by making it mathematically unfavorable for the model to create overlapping features, thereby improving monosemanticity. The modification is lightweight, requiring only an additional loss term computed efficiently via inner products of normalized decoder weights. This should improve core metrics (better L2 ratio via reduced interference) and sparse_probing performance (more distinct features map to cleaner concepts) without major architectural changes. The implementation involves adding a cosine similarity matrix penalty to the existing loss function, balancing sparsity with feature independence.

The prior idea requires refinement to boost novelty while maintaining simplicity. By focusing the orthogonality penalty on normalized decoder weights and using squared cosine similarities, we create a more targeted regularization that directly enforces directional diversity without magnitude effects. This leverages the SAE's inherent decoder normalization (unit norm columns) to specialize the penalty purely to angular relationships between features. Squared terms disproportionately penalize high correlations critical for feature absorption. The implementation remains lightweight (matrix mult + mean) but gains conceptual novelty through SAE-specific geometric constraints.

Low-level groups capture predictable patterns through localized sparsity constraints, preventing higher-level features from absorbing their functionality. This structured sparsity approach combines the efficiency of standard SAEs with hierarchical compositionality, enabling precise control over feature granularity while maintaining mathematical tractability. The method provides built-in protections against common failure modes like feature absorption through its level-specific activation constraints.'}

The revised hierarchical grouping approach shows promise but can be further refined by: 1) Replacing explicit orthogonality penalties with learned magnitude-based subspace specialization 2) Implementing fixed abstraction-level groupings aligned with benchmark tasks 3) Adding progressive sparsity constraints where lower-level groups have stricter activation limits. This simplifies implementation while strengthening the absorption prevention mechanism through architectural guarantees rather than pure regularization.

During forward pass, tiers activate in order with f_t(x) = TopK(ReLU(W_t(x - ⊕_{i<t}f_i(x)) + b_enc_t), k_t). Backpropagation stops gradients from higher tiers (t+1) to lower tiers (<=t), enforcing strict feature hierarchy. k values follow k_char = floor(0.2k_total), k_token = floor(0.5k_total), k_syntax = k_total - k_char - k_token, ensuring character features activate first with tightest sparsity.', 'Implementation_Plan': ['1.

Character-level features activate first with strict sparsity constraints, followed by token and syntax-level features operating on residuals. Backpropagation prevents higher-tier gradients from affecting lower tiers, creating irreversible feature commitments. This architecture guarantees atomic features (e.g., character patterns) cannot be absorbed by higher-level representations due to gradient isolation, while maintaining full model expressivity through tier composition. The method provides verifiable hierarchical decomposition through its fixed activation order and gradient control mechanisms.'}

 content is THOUGHT:
The previous hierarchical coherence idea has strong potential but needs refinement to achieve target scores. To boost feasibility, we can simplify the hierarchy detection by using the existing top-k selection indices rather than full pairwise comparisons. Instead of tracking all P(f_j|f_i), we'll maintain exponential moving averages (EMA) of co-activation counts between top-k features. The loss can then penalize child features (high P(f_j|f_i)) that activate without their parents using a simple margin-based approach. This reduces computation from O(k^2) to O(k) per sample while maintaining the core intuition. Implementation becomes primarily about adding EMAs to the trainer and modifying the loss function - well within junior developer capabilities. Novelty remains strong as this constitutes the first application of adaptive hierarchical constraints in SAEs.
