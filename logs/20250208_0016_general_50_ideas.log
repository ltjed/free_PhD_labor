The proposed idea introduces dynamic sparsity thresholds in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to address feature underutilization and polysemanticity. Current SAE approaches use fixed sparsity constraints (e.g., Top-K or L1 penalties) that treat all features equally, potentially leading to dead features and feature absorption. By implementing per-feature adaptive thresholds that adjust based on activation frequency during training, the model can automatically balance feature usage - suppressing overactive features while reviving underused ones. This builds on existing SAE architectures by adding simple threshold parameters and update rules, avoiding complex new components. The approach should improve core metrics by reducing dead features (Feature Density Statistics) while maintaining sparsity (L0), enhance sparse_probing through more distinct feature representations, and aid unlearning via clearer feature separability. Implementation involves modifying the activation function to include trainable thresholds and adding frequency-based update rules, requiring minimal code changes to existing SAE training loops.

The core challenge in SAE interpretability is ensuring learned features are truly monosemantic. Current SAEs use sparsity penalties but don't explicitly enforce feature independence, leading to entangled representations. My idea introduces orthogonal regularization on decoder weights to encourage axis-aligned, independent features. By adding a regularization term that penalizes non-orthogonal decoder vectors, we force the SAE to learn features that occupy distinct directions in activation space. This builds on the Matryoshka SAE concept by adding geometric constraints without complex architectural changes.

The orthogonal SAE idea shows promise but requires refinement for higher impact.

The refined idea maintains the core adaptive orthogonality concept but simplifies implementation by replacing explicit Gram-Schmidt with a soft regularization penalty. By using thresholded average squared cosines as the loss term and dynamic regularization weighting, we achieve similar disentanglement benefits with lower computational complexity. This approach better balances feasibility and impact while directly targeting the absorption benchmark through learned geometric constraints. The removal of explicit orthogonalization steps reduces code complexity while maintaining the adaptive triggering mechanism's benefits.

THOUGHT:
The refined idea maintains the core adaptive orthogonality concept but simplifies implementation by replacing explicit Gram-Schmidt with a soft regularization penalty. By using thresholded average squared cosines as the loss term and dynamic regularization weighting, we achieve similar disentanglement benefits with lower computational complexity. This approach better balances feasibility and impact while directly targeting the absorption benchmark through learned geometric constraints. The removal of explicit orthogonalization steps reduces code complexity while maintaining the adaptive triggering mechanism's benefits.

The proposed idea introduces a stochastic pairwise cosine similarity penalty applied to decoder weights during SAE training. This approach addresses feature absorption by directly targeting geometric overlaps between decoder vectors, which are a root cause of polysemanticity. Unlike full orthogonalization methods that impose strict constraints, this method uses randomized sampling of feature pairs to maintain computational efficiency while still encouraging diverse feature directions. By only penalizing the most problematic overlaps through a thresholded ReLU loss, the method preserves reconstruction capacity while promoting feature disentanglement. The implementation requires minimal code changes - adding a sampled similarity calculation to the existing loss function - making it feasible to integrate with current SAE architectures. This targeted regularization should improve absorption metrics by reducing feature mergers and enhance sparse probing performance through more distinct feature representations, without significantly impacting core reconstruction metrics.

Iteration 3/5

 content is THOUGHT:
This iteration simplifies the adaptive threshold mechanism by using per-batch percentiles instead of historical EMAs, reducing memory/compute overhead while maintaining adaptivity. By calculating thresholds directly from current batch statistics and limiting penalized pairs to the top 10% of similarities, the method becomes more responsive to immediate feature relationships. The changes preserve the core innovation of activation-guided regularization while improving feasibility through reduced state tracking. Implementation remains straightforward with PyTorch's built-in percentile functions and tensor operations, now requiring <20 lines of code changes. These adjustments should maintain strong absorption improvements while better meeting strict feasibility constraints.

The proposed Dynamic Zipfian Sparsity Penalty addresses feature absorption by dynamically adjusting per-feature sparsity constraints based on their activation frequency relative to an ideal Zipf distribution. Traditional SAEs apply uniform L1 penalties, which can paradoxically encourage absorption - frequent features become overloaded while rare features die out. By tracking exponential moving averages (EMA) of feature activations and scaling penalties inversely to their position in a sorted activation ranking, we create pressure for natural feature specialization patterns. This matches the power-law distribution observed in human-interpretable features while maintaining computational simplicity. The implementation modifies only the loss calculation, adding EMA tracking and rank-based penalty scaling without architectural changes. By aligning sparsity constraints with expected feature frequency distributions, we hypothesize improved absorption metrics through reduced gerrymandering and better sparse probing performance via more stable feature specialization.

The final refinement introduces activation-adaptive Zipf shift calculation and robust loss scaling while preserving O(d_sae) complexity. By setting shift s = 5 + 2*(\u03bc_layer/\u03bc_global), where \u03bc_layer is the layer's average activation magnitude, we dynamically adapt to intrinsic feature density variations. Replace squared error with Huber loss for penalty scaling (\u03b4=0.1) to handle outliers gracefully. EMA warmup uses cosine annealing from \u03b1=0.8 to 0.99 over 2000 steps. These changes eliminate manual layer indexing while better matching actual activation statistics, maintaining implementation simplicity through PyTorch-native functions.
