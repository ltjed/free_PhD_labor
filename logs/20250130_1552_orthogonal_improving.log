THOUGHT:
The prototype idea introduces temporal modeling for SAEs, but adds significant complexity through correlation tracking and chain-based interventions. I propose refining this into a simpler but potentially more effective approach: Matryoshka SAEs that learn nested feature hierarchies. 

The key insight is that feature absorption often happens because the SAE has no incentive to maintain clean hierarchical representations. By explicitly training nested subsets of features (like Russian dolls), we encourage the model to learn general features first before specialized ones. This addresses feature absorption without requiring temporal modeling or complex interventions.

The core mechanism is simple: we train multiple reconstruction losses simultaneously, where each uses a progressively larger subset of features. Early features must work well across all reconstructions, naturally pushing them toward capturing fundamental patterns. Later features can specialize since they only participate in the full reconstruction.

This should improve mechanistic interpretability by:
1. Reducing feature absorption through explicit hierarchical learning
2. Creating more interpretable early features that capture core patterns
3. Maintaining computational efficiency through shared parameters
4. Requiring minimal changes to the existing architecture

The approach refines the temporal modeling goal of the prototype into a simpler static hierarchical structure while preserving the aim of better feature organization.

THOUGHT:
Upon review, while the Matryoshka SAE idea is interesting, it deviates too far from the temporal aspects of the prototype idea. Let's return to temporal modeling but simplify it significantly compared to the prototype.

The key insight is that temporal information can help prevent feature absorption without requiring complex correlation tracking or chain-based interventions. Instead, we can use a simple sliding window approach where features are encouraged to maintain consistent activations across consecutive tokens.

This addresses feature absorption because absorbed features tend to exhibit inconsistent temporal patterns - they might represent "starts with S" for some tokens but not others, leading to "jumpy" activation patterns. By adding a small temporal consistency loss, we encourage features to maintain their semantic meaning across time.

Improvements over previous version:
1. Better alignment with prototype's temporal focus
2. Simpler implementation (just sliding window consistency)
3. Higher feasibility (no complex correlation tracking)
4. Stronger theoretical motivation (temporal consistency as regularization)
5. More direct attack on feature absorption problem

The ratings were also too low - this idea deserves higher scores given its simplicity and potential impact.
