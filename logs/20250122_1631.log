The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

reasoning_content is Okay, I need to come up with a new idea for improving sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to address polysemanticity and improve interpretability, specifically targeting the SCR and TPP benchmarks. Let me start by understanding the problem again. The key issue is that SAEs sometimes learn features that combine multiple concepts (polysemanticity), making them hard to interpret. The benchmarks SCR and TPP measure how well SAEs can isolate and remove spurious correlations (SCR) and disentangle class-specific features (TPP).

Looking at the existing ideas provided, they've explored various approaches like adaptive computation, gating mechanisms, clustering, mutual regularization, etc. My idea needs to be novel and feasible. Let's think about what causes polysemanticity. The original paper mentions superposition, where features are represented in overcomplete directions. Maybe if we can enforce a structure in the latent space that separates features more distinctly, we could reduce polysemanticity.

Orthogonal features might help. If the latent features are orthogonal, each feature would be more distinct, reducing overlap. But how to enforce this? One approach could be adding an orthogonality constraint on the encoder weights. Alternatively, a regularization term that encourages the features to be orthogonal. That way, the SAE is pushed to learn features that are less correlated, which might lead to more monosemantic features.

Another angle is using contrastive learning. If we can ensure that features activated for different concepts are dissimilar, maybe through a contrastive loss, that could help. But integrating contrastive learning into SAE training might complicate things. Maybe a simpler approach is better.

Wait, orthogonality in the decoder weights has been used in some prior work to prevent feature entanglement. But applying it to the encoder or the latent activations might be different. If the latent features are encouraged to be orthogonal, they might capture independent factors of variation. This could reduce the chances of a single latent representing multiple concepts.

So the idea is to modify the SAE loss function to include an orthogonality regularization term on the latent activations. For example, a term that minimizes the cosine similarity between different latent features' activation patterns across a batch. This would push the SAE to learn features that activate independently, reducing polysemanticity.

Let me outline this:

1. Modify the SAE's loss function to include a regularization term that enforces orthogonality in the latent activations.
2. The regularization could be based on the covariance matrix of the latent activations, encouraging it to be diagonal (i.e., features are uncorrelated).
3. Train the SAE with this modified loss and evaluate on SCR and TPP benchmarks.

The technical details would involve computing the covariance of the latent features over a batch and adding a term that penalizes off-diagonal elements. For example, using the Frobenius norm of the covariance matrix minus the identity matrix. Alternatively, using a pairwise cosine similarity penalty between different latents.

But how computationally expensive is this? Calculating pairwise similarities for all latents could be expensive if the latent dimension is large. Maybe a more efficient way is to compute the covariance matrix and then penalize the off-diagonal terms.

In terms of implementation, during training, after computing the latent activations (f), calculate the covariance matrix of f across the batch. Then, add a term to the loss that is the sum of the squares of the off-diagonal elements. This would encourage the features to be uncorrelated, which is a form of orthogonality in their activation patterns.

By doing this, the SAE is incentivized to have each latent feature capture distinct, independent factors. This should reduce polysemanticity because if two concepts are orthogonal, they can't be represented by the same latent. So, in SCR, when you ablate gender-related features, the profession features remain intact because they're in separate, orthogonal latents. Similarly, for TPP, ablating class-specific features would only affect that class's probe, as the latents are disentangled.

Now, how does this differ from existing ideas? The existing ideas focus on different activation functions, gating, adaptive sparsity, etc. None of them explicitly enforce orthogonality in the latent space. The mutual feature regularization encourages features to be present across SAEs but doesn't address the structure within a single SAE. So this is a novel approach.

Implementation plan: Modify the SAE's forward pass to compute the covariance regularization term. Add this term to the loss with a scaling factor (lambda). Adjust the training loop to include this new loss component.

Feasibility-wise, adding a covariance regularization term is straightforward. The main code change would be in the loss calculation. The covariance matrix can be computed using torch functions. The rest of the SAE structure remains the same. Training time might increase slightly due to the added computation, but it should be manageable on an H100 within 30 minutes if the batch size and latent dimensions are reasonable.

Potential challenges include tuning the regularization strength (lambda) to balance sparsity and orthogonality. But since the existing code already has hyperparameters like L1 penalty, adding another term is feasible.

Testing this on the SCR and TPP benchmarks would involve training the modified SAE and then running the existing evaluation scripts. If the orthogonality regularization works, we should see higher SCR scores (better removal of spurious correlations) and higher TPP scores (more isolated class-specific features).

In terms of research impact, improving SCR and TPP directly targets the benchmarks. By enforcing orthogonality, the SAE should better isolate features, making ablation more precise. This would lead to higher S_SHIFT and S_TPP scores, indicating better interpretability.

So the JSON would outline this idea with the Name as "orthogonal_sparse_autoencoder", Title mentioning orthogonality constraints, and the technical details focusing on covariance regularization. The implementation plan would modify the loss function in the CustomTrainer's loss method, adding the covariance term.
content is THOUGHT:
The key insight is that enforcing orthogonality constraints in the latent space could mitigate polysemanticity by encouraging features to represent independent semantic concepts. Traditional SAEs only use L1 sparsity penalties which don't explicitly prevent feature entanglement. By adding a covariance regularization term that penalizes correlated activations across features, we theoretically create more disentangled representations. This directly targets SCR/TPP benchmarks by ensuring spurious correlations (SCR) and class-specific features (TPP) occupy orthogonal subspaces, enabling cleaner ablation. Unlike prior work focusing on activation functions or architecture changes, this approach modifies the learning objective itself to induce geometric structure in feature space.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

Traditional SAEs only use L1 sparsity penalties which don\'t explicitly prevent feature entanglement. By adding a covariance regularization term that penalizes correlated activations across features, we theoretically create more disentangled representations. This directly targets SCR/TPP benchmarks by ensuring spurious correlations (SCR) and class-specific features (TPP) occupy orthogonal subspaces, enabling cleaner ablation. Unlike prior work focusing on activation functions or architecture changes, this approach modifies the learning objective itself to induce geometric structure in feature space.\n\nNEW IDEA JSON:\n```json\n{\n    "Name": "orthogonal_sparse_autoencoder",\n    "Title": "Orthogonality-Constrained Sparse Autoencoders for Disentangled Interpretability",\n    "Experiment": "1.
