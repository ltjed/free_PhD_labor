*Starting Experiments*
Starting experiment with prompt for coder: Your goal is to implement the following idea: Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoders for Targeted Knowledge Unlearning.
The proposed experiment is as follows: 1. Implement periodic feature correlation computation
2. Add agglomerative clustering for feature hierarchy construction
3. Modify unlearning process to use hierarchical feature groups
4. Train on Gemma-2B activations with standard SAE objectives
5. Compare against baseline using expanded evaluation metrics
6. Analyze hierarchy stability and feature group coherence
7. Measure fine-grained unlearning precision.
You are given a total of up to 10 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 10.

First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.

Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.

For reference, the baseline results are as follows:
