THOUGHT:
The prototype idea focuses on orthogonality between features, but I believe we can refine this to directly target the feature absorption problem while maintaining simplicity. Feature absorption occurs when one feature subsumes another due to their statistical relationship (e.g., "short" absorbing "starts with S"). Rather than enforcing strict orthogonality which may be too restrictive, we can introduce a targeted regularization that penalizes feature absorption specifically.

The key insight is that feature absorption manifests as one feature's activation pattern being a subset of another's. We can detect and discourage this by comparing activation patterns between features in each batch. This is simpler than the prototype's full orthogonality constraint while being more directly relevant to the problem.

The modification maintains the core SAE architecture but adds a targeted regularization term during training. This should improve interpretability by preventing features from merging in undesirable ways, while being computationally efficient since we only need to compare activation patterns within each batch.

THOUGHT:
Looking at my previous idea, I realize the activation pattern comparison could be refined to be even more targeted and efficient. Instead of comparing all feature pairs, which could be computationally expensive at scale, we can focus on features that are most likely to exhibit absorption based on their activation statistics. We can maintain running estimates of feature activation correlations and only compute the detailed pattern comparison for the most correlated pairs.

This refinement makes the approach more scalable while maintaining its core purpose. Additionally, by tracking feature correlations over time rather than just within batches, we get a more reliable signal for potential absorption. This addresses a limitation in the previous version where batch-level statistics might be noisy.

The main changes are:
1. More efficient implementation by selective pair comparison
2. Better statistical reliability through temporal tracking
3. Clearer connection to the feature absorption benchmark

These refinements maintain the simplicity of the original approach while making it more practical and effective.

THOUGHT:
Upon further reflection, I realize the previous approach with correlation tracking might still be overly complex and could be simplified while maintaining its effectiveness. The key insight is that we don't need temporal tracking at all - we can detect potential absorption directly from the current batch's activation patterns using a simpler metric: activation frequency ratios.

When one feature absorbs another, their activation frequencies will show a characteristic pattern - the absorbing feature will activate almost every time the absorbed feature activates. This can be computed efficiently using just counts within the current batch, eliminating the need for correlation tracking or exponential moving averages.

This simplification:
1. Reduces implementation complexity
2. Makes the method more interpretable
3. Improves computational efficiency
4. Maintains the core anti-absorption objective
5. Makes hyperparameter tuning easier

The simplified approach is more aligned with the spirit of the original prototype idea while being more practical to implement and tune.

THOUGHT:
The frequency ratio approach is already quite streamlined, but we can make one final refinement to make it even more efficient and theoretically grounded. Instead of computing ratios for all feature pairs, we can focus on features that are active together above a certain rate in the batch. This naturally captures potential absorption cases while reducing computation.

Additionally, we can make the threshold τ adaptive based on the sparsity level - when features are very sparse, even a lower co-activation ratio might indicate absorption. This makes the method more robust across different sparsity settings without adding complexity.

These refinements make the method:
1. More computationally efficient
2. More theoretically sound
3. More robust across different sparsity levels
4. Easier to implement and maintain

This represents the optimal balance between simplicity and effectiveness. The changes are minimal but impactful, staying true to the core idea while maximizing practical utility.

I believe this version achieves the best possible balance of novelty, feasibility, and potential impact while maintaining extreme simplicity. I am done.
