Each layer l receives input from both the original activations and the encoded features from layer l-1. The loss function combines: (1) Standard reconstruction loss for each layer, (2) Composition loss encouraging higher layer features to be expressible as sparse combinations of lower layer features, (3) Skip connection loss ensuring each layer can still reconstruct original activations. Training proceeds in two phases: (a) Layer-wise pre-training where each SAE is trained while keeping lower layers fixed, (b) End-to-end fine-tuning with reduced learning rate. The composition loss uses a learnable sparse matrix W_l between adjacent layers, with L1 penalty to encourage feature reuse.', 'Research_Impact': 'A major challenge in mechanistic interpretability is understanding how language models compose low-level features into higher-level concepts. Current SAEs struggle to capture this hierarchical structure, making it difficult to trace causal chains of computation. HSAE directly addresses this by explicitly modeling feature composition across multiple scales.

For each checkpoint, compute sparse feature profiles using Lasso probes with stability scoring: stability(f) = mean(corr(f_i, f_j)) across bootstrap samples. Temporal weighting uses continuous function: w(t,f) = exp(-(t-μ_f)²/2σ_f²) where μ_f, σ_f are learned per-feature timing parameters. Loss function: L = L_recon + Σ_f λ_f(t)||f||₁ where λ_f(t) = λ_base * w(t,f) * stability(f). Implementation uses efficient caching of checkpoint activations and incremental stability updates. For unlearning, intervention strength α_f = α_base * (1-w(t_final,f)) * stability(f) to target stable late-emerging features. Added temporal consistency metric: TC = Σ_f corr(emergence(f), target_profile(f))', 'Research_Impact': 'A key challenge in selective unlearning is distinguishing between fundamental capabilities and specific knowledge in language models while maintaining computational feasibility. The refined TCSAE addresses this through three key improvements: (1) efficient temporal profiling using strategic checkpoint selection, (2) stability-aware continuous temporal weighting, and (3) precise targeting of stable late-emerging features. The addition of rigorous stability metrics and efficient implementation makes the approach practical for large-scale deployment while potentially improving unlearning performance through more reliable feature targeting.', 'Interestingness': 9, 'Feasibility': 8, 'Novelty': 8}

*Starting Experiments*
Starting experiment with prompt for coder: Your goal is to implement the following idea: Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoders for Multi-Scale Feature Learning in Language Models.
The proposed experiment is as follows: 1. Implement 2-layer HSAE with curriculum learning
2. Define composition loss ||W_l * h_{l-1} - h_l||₂² with L1 penalty on W_l
3. Train on Gemma-2B activations using progressive layer addition
4. Measure feature composition sparsity and hierarchical consistency
5. Implement hierarchical unlearning intervention
6. Compare against baseline SAE on reconstruction and unlearning
7. Visualize feature composition patterns
8. Ablate curriculum learning and loss components.
You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.

First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.

Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.

For reference, the baseline results are as follows:

After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.
YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.
You can then implement the next thing on your list.

Let's run this first version and evaluate the results before moving on to adding curriculum learning in Run 2.                                                             

The command to run this experiment will be:

After we get the results, we can analyze them and proceed with implementing the curriculum learning aspect in Run 2.

Let me fix those errors. We need to update the logging section to use the correct loss variables and fix the trainer initialization:

The error occurs because the ConstrainedAdam optimizer is looking for W_dec but our hierarchical SAE has W_dec1 and W_dec2. Let's fix this by updating both the SAE and    
trainer classes.

WARNING: We recommend running this eval on instruct tuned models



coder_out: The error occurs because the `ConstrainedAdam` optimizer is looking for `W_dec` but our hierarchical SAE has `W_dec1` and `W_dec2`. Let's fix this by updating both the SAE and trainer classes.

Here are the necessary changes:

```

These changes:
1. Update the optimizer to constrain both decoder weight matrices (W_dec1 and W_dec2)
2. Modify the resample_neurons method to handle both layers of the hierarchical architecture
3. Fix the parameter indexing in the Adam state dictionary reset

Try running the experiment again with these changes.

I see the issue - we need to modify the evaluation types since we're using Gemma-2B which is not an instruct-tuned model. Let's update the evaluation types in             
experiment.py to use only the appropriate evaluations.
