Implement phased training with Mutual Choice followed by Feature Choice', 'Technical_Details': 'The paper proposes two novel sparse autoencoder (SAE) variants: Feature Choice (FC) and Mutual Choice (MC). These allow for variable numbers of active features per token, framing the token-feature matching as a resource allocation problem with a total sparsity upper bound. The FC approach allows each feature to select m tokens to process, where m = M/F (M is total matches, F is number of features). MC combines aspects of FC and token choice. A new aux_zipf_loss is introduced to encourage feature densities to follow a Zipf distribution, mitigating feature under-utilization. The paper also suggests a phased training approach, starting with MC and transitioning to FC.', 'Research_Impact': 'A key challenge in mechanistic interpretability is extracting meaningful, interpretable features from neural networks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Analyze latent activation patterns and flexibility in latent allocation.', 'Technical_Details': 'BatchTopK is a novel training method for Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that replaces the sample-level TopK operation with a batch-level constraint. Instead of enforcing a fixed number of active latents per sample, BatchTopK selects the top activations across the entire batch. This allows for variable sparsity per sample, with some samples using more latents and others using fewer. The method introduces a batch dependency during training, which is addressed during inference by estimating a global threshold parameter. This threshold is calculated as the average of minimum positive activation values across multiple batches. The SAE is trained on language model activations (e.g., from the residual stream) using a large text corpus. The loss function combines L2 reconstruction error with an L0 sparsity penalty.

After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.
YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.
You can then implement the next thing on your list.

torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 3.79 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 19.50 GiB of which 3.51 GiB is free. Process 12032 has 13.49 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 15.96 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 15.51 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 298.79 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.

The error indicates we're running out of GPU memory when trying to run the experiment. Let's modify the code to reduce memory usage for Run 1.                                     

Key changes needed:                                                                                                                                                                

 1 Reduce batch sizes

 1 Reduce memory usage by using smaller batch sizes                                                                                                                                
 2 Enable gradient checkpointing to save memory                                                                                                                                    
 3 Clear CUDA cache before training and periodically during training                                                                                                               
 4 Add error handling to automatically reduce batch sizes if we hit OOM                                                                                                            

Let's try running again with these memory optimizations:                                                                                                                           

                                                                                                                                                                                   
 PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                   

The environment variable PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True helps reduce memory fragmentation.                                                                       

If we still run out of memory, we can further reduce the batch sizes or try running on a GPU with more memory. Let me know how it goes!

Just reply with fixed versions of the block above that failed to match.

I'll help fix the SEARCH block to match the exact content in experiment.py. Looking at the file, I see the buffer_size and batch sizes are defined in the run_sae_training function

torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 3.79 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 19.50 GiB of which 3.51 GiB is free. Process 12032 has 13.49 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 15.96 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 15.51 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 298.79 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
