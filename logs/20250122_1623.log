The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

reasoning_content is Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a new SAE variant that improves interpretability, specifically targeting the SCR and TPP benchmarks. The existing ideas have explored various approaches like adaptive computation, gating, clustering, and mutual regularization. 

First, I need to understand the core issues. The main problem is polysemanticity, where a single latent feature represents multiple concepts. This makes it hard to isolate features for tasks like debiasing (SCR) or targeted ablation (TPP). The SCR benchmark requires the SAE to separate spurious correlations (e.g., gender and profession) so that ablating gender-related features doesn't affect profession classification. Similarly, TPP needs features that are disentangled so ablating one set only affects the corresponding class.

Looking at previous solutions, the Matryoshka SAE uses nested dictionaries to encourage hierarchy, which might help in separating high-level vs. low-level features. But maybe we can go further by explicitly modeling hierarchical relationships between features. If features are organized hierarchically, like parent and child nodes, it might reduce polysemanticity by capturing broader categories and specific sub-features separately. For example, a "gender" parent feature could have "male" and "female" children, while "profession" has "nurse" and "professor". This structure could make it easier to ablate entire parent features without affecting unrelated concepts.

Another angle is feature interaction. Current SAEs might not account for how features relate, leading to absorption. A hierarchical approach could enforce that certain features only activate in the context of their parent, reducing overlap. For SCR, if gender features are under a parent node, selecting that parent for ablation would remove all gender-related signals more effectively, improving SCR scores.

Technical details: Implementing a hierarchical SAE would involve grouping latent units into parent-child clusters. The parent features could gate the activation of child features. For example, a parent feature's activation is computed first, and then child features are only active if the parent is above a threshold. This could be done with a modified activation function where child features are masked unless their parent is active. The loss function might include terms to encourage sparsity at both parent and child levels, and perhaps a regularization term to minimize overlap between different parent groups.

Implementation plan: Modify the SAE architecture to have hierarchical layers. The encoder could have two parts: one for parent features and another for children. The parent features are computed normally, and child features are computed but masked unless their corresponding parent is active. The decoder would combine both parent and child features. Training would require adjusting the loss to account for this hierarchy, maybe with separate sparsity penalties for each level.

Research impact: Hierarchical features should naturally disentangle higher-level concepts (gender) from lower-level ones (profession), making it easier to isolate and ablate them. For SCR, ablating the entire gender hierarchy should remove spurious correlations more effectively than individual features, leading to higher SHIFT scores. For TPP, hierarchical features would allow precise ablation targeting, as parent nodes correspond to broader classes, reducing cross-talk between probes.

Feasibility: The main challenge is modifying the SAE structure and training loop. The existing code uses a standard encoder-decoder. Adding parent-child groups would require defining a new layer structure. The activation function needs to mask child features based on parent activations. However, this can be implemented with a custom forward pass. The loss function adjustments are manageable. Training might take longer due to increased complexity, but if the hierarchy is kept shallow (e.g., two levels), it should fit within the computational constraints.

Novelty: While some existing ideas use clustering or nested structures, explicit hierarchical relationships with parent-child gating haven't been explored. This approach directly targets the structure of features to enforce semantic separation, which is novel compared to methods focusing on sparsity or adaptive computation.

Potential issues: Ensuring that the hierarchy is learned correctly without supervision. The model might not naturally group features into meaningful hierarchies. To mitigate, perhaps initialize parent features using domain knowledge (e.g., predefined concepts for SCR tasks) or use auxiliary losses to encourage grouping.

In conclusion, a hierarchical SAE with parent-child feature gating could better disentangle concepts, leading to improved SCR and TPP scores by making feature ablation more precise and reducing polysemanticity.
content is THOUGHT:
The key insight is that hierarchical feature organization could reduce polysemanticity by explicitly modeling concept relationships. Current SAEs treat all features as flat, but human-understandable concepts often form taxonomies (e.g. "mammal" → "dog"). By structuring latents into parent-child groups where child features only activate when their parent does, we force the model to separate abstraction levels. For SCR, this should better isolate spurious correlations (e.g. gender hierarchy vs profession hierarchy) since ablating a parent feature would disable all related children. For TPP, hierarchical features enable class-specific ablation without cross-talk between unrelated categories. This differs from prior work by introducing structural constraints rather than just modifying sparsity patterns.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

Current SAEs treat all features as flat, but human-understandable concepts often form taxonomies (e.g. "mammal" → "dog"). By structuring latents into parent-child groups where child features only activate when their parent does, we force the model to separate abstraction levels. For SCR, this should better isolate spurious correlations (e.g. gender hierarchy vs profession hierarchy) since ablating a parent feature would disable all related children.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed.

reasoning_content is Okay, let's see. The user wants a new idea for improving sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to address polysemanticity and improve interpretability, specifically targeting the SCR and TPP benchmarks. They provided some existing ideas, so I need to make sure the new idea is novel and feasible.

First, I need to understand the problem. Polysemanticity means that individual features in the SAE's latent space represent multiple concepts, which makes interpretation hard. The SCR benchmark measures how well the SAE can isolate features so that ablating certain latents removes spurious correlations (like gender) without affecting the target concept (like profession). TPP is similar but for multiple classes, ensuring that ablating a class's latents only affects that class.

Existing ideas like Matryoshka SAE use nested dictionaries to encourage hierarchical features. Others use different activation functions or training procedures. The challenge is to find a method that forces the SAE to separate features more cleanly.

Hmm, maybe adding a contrastive loss component? Contrastive learning encourages similar items to be close and dissimilar ones apart. If we apply this to the latent features, perhaps we can push different concepts into separate latents. But how to structure the contrastive pairs?

Wait, in the context of SCR, we have datasets with spurious correlations. Suppose during training, we have samples where certain features are known to be correlated. If we can create positive and negative pairs based on these features, the contrastive loss could help the SAE learn to separate them.

Alternatively, maybe a disentanglement approach. Disentangled representations have features that correspond to single underlying factors. Adding a penalty term that minimizes mutual information between different latents could reduce polysemanticity. But mutual information is hard to estimate.

Another angle: the SCR benchmark requires that ablating gender-related features doesn't hurt profession classification. So the SAE needs to have gender features isolated. Maybe during training, we can use auxiliary labels (like gender) to guide the SAE to separate features. For example, a multi-task loss where some latents are trained to predict the spurious feature (gender), and others are trained to predict the target (profession), with a penalty if they overlap.

But the problem is that in real scenarios, we might not have such labels during SAE training. The current SCR setup uses probes post-hoc. So maybe the SAE needs to be trained in a self-supervised way that naturally separates features.

Wait, the idea of using contrastive learning without labels. For example, for each input activation, create augmented versions (e.g., by adding noise) and enforce that their latent representations are similar. But this might not directly address feature separation.

Alternatively, use the fact that in the SCR setup, the spurious and target features are present in the data. The SAE could be trained with an additional loss that penalizes latents from activating on both features. For example, if a latent is active when the input has feature A (gender), it should not be active when feature B (profession) is present, unless they co-occur. But without labels, how to enforce this?

Maybe a clustering-based approach. If the SAE's latents are encouraged to form clusters corresponding to different concepts, this might reduce polysemanticity. For example, using a clustering loss term that groups similar features together in the latent space.

Alternatively, a modular SAE where latents are partitioned into groups, each encouraged to capture different aspects. For instance, some groups are for gender, others for profession. But again, without supervision, how to partition?

Wait, the key insight from the original paper is that SAEs can learn more monosemantic features by leveraging sparsity and overcompleteness. Maybe the existing methods don't enforce enough separation between features. So, a possible approach is to modify the SAE's architecture or training objective to explicitly encourage orthogonality between features.

Orthogonal SAE: Adding a term in the loss that minimizes the cosine similarity between different decoder weights. This would push the features to be orthogonal, reducing overlap and thus polysemanticity. However, strictly enforcing orthogonality might be too restrictive and harm reconstruction.

Another idea is to use a diversity regularization term. For example, penalize the covariance matrix of the latent activations to encourage independence between features. If the features are less correlated, they might capture more distinct concepts.

But how does this translate to the SCR and TPP benchmarks? If the features are more independent, then ablating a subset (gender-related) would affect only the corresponding probe, improving SCR and TPP scores.

Alternatively, using a mixture of experts approach where different experts handle different types of features. But the existing Switch SAE idea is similar.

Wait, looking at the existing ideas, some use different activation functions (JumpReLU, TopK), others modify the architecture (Gated, Switch), and others use auxiliary losses (aux_zipf, MFR). The next idea should be different.

What if we use a dynamic sparsity penalty? Instead of a fixed L1 penalty, adjust the penalty per feature based on how polysemantic it is. Features that activate in diverse contexts get a higher penalty, encouraging them to split into more specific features. But measuring polysemanticity during training is tricky.

Alternatively, during training, periodically measure the interpretability of features (using automated methods) and adjust the training objective to favor more interpretable features. But this would require an online interpretability metric, which might be computationally expensive.

Another angle: hierarchical SAEs. First, learn high-level features, then within each, learn sub-features. This could separate broad categories (gender, profession) first, then specifics. But integrating this into the existing SAE framework might be complex.

Wait, the SCR metric involves training probes post-hoc. Maybe during SAE training, incorporate probe-based feedback. For example, train the SAE along with auxiliary probes that predict certain attributes, and penalize latents that are predictive of multiple attributes. But this requires labeled data for the attributes, which might not be available.

Alternatively, use unsupervised clustering of the SAE's latents and enforce that each cluster corresponds to a single concept. The loss could include a term that encourages each latent to belong to a single cluster. However, clustering in high-dimensional spaces is challenging.

Hmm, perhaps a simpler approach is to modify the decoder weights to be more orthogonal. If the decoder vectors are orthogonal, then each latent corresponds to a unique direction in the activation space, reducing superposition. The existing ConstrainedAdam in the code already constrains decoder weights to unit norm. Maybe adding an orthogonal regularization term to the decoder weights.

So the idea is: Orthogonal Sparse Autoencoder (OrthoSAE). The decoder matrix W_dec is encouraged to have orthogonal columns. This would enforce that each feature direction is orthogonal, reducing interference between features and potentially leading to more monosemantic features.

Orthogonality can be encouraged by adding a term to the loss that minimizes the off-diagonal elements of W_dec.T @ W_dec. For example, the loss could include the Frobenius norm of (W_dec.T @ W_dec - I), which pushes the columns towards orthogonality.

This approach is different from existing ideas because it directly enforces structural constraints on the decoder weights, which should lead to more independent features. If features are orthogonal, they are less likely to interfere, reducing polysemanticity. This should help in SCR and TPP because ablating a set of features (e.g., gender) would not affect other features (profession) as much, since their directions are orthogonal.

Implementation-wise, the main modification would be adding an orthogonality regularization term to the loss function. The existing code for the SAE has a loss that combines L2 reconstruction and L1 sparsity. Adding a term lambda * ||W_dec.T @ W_dec - I||_F^2 would do that. The ConstrainedAdam optimizer already normalizes the decoder weights, which might help with orthogonality, but explicit regularization would further encourage it.

In terms of experiments, training such an OrthoSAE and evaluating on SCR and TPP benchmarks should show improved scores compared to baseline SAEs. The technical details involve the modified loss function and possibly adjusting the regularization strength.

Potential challenges include balancing the orthogonality term with the other loss components. Too much weight on orthogonality might harm reconstruction quality. Also, ensuring that the decoder remains effective while being orthogonal.

Research impact: By enforcing orthogonality, the SAE's features are more likely to correspond to distinct concepts, which directly addresses polysemanticity. This should improve SCR and TPP scores because the features are better disentangled, allowing precise ablation of spurious signals without affecting target concepts. If the OrthoSAE's features are more monosemantic, then ablating gender-related features would remove those directions cleanly, leading to better debiasing in SCR and more isolated effects in TPP.

Implementation plan: Modify the SAE's loss function to include the orthogonality regularization. Adjust the training loop to compute this term and add it to the total loss. Tune the regularization coefficient lambda. Evaluate on the existing SCR and TPP benchmarks.

Feasibility: The code change is minimal—adding a regularization term. The existing code already computes the loss, so adding the new term is straightforward. The experiment setup remains the same, so no major changes there. Feasibility is high. The runtime might increase slightly due to the additional computation, but since it's a matrix multiplication, it's manageable on an H100 within 30 minutes.

Novelty: While orthogonality constraints are known in other areas of ML, applying them specifically to SAEs for mechanistic interpretability is novel. Existing SAE variants don't enforce decoder orthogonality explicitly, making this a new approach.
content is THOUGHT:
The proposed Orthogonal Sparse Autoencoder (OrthoSAE) introduces explicit orthogonality constraints on decoder weights to combat polysemanticity through geometric separation of feature directions. By adding a regularization term that minimizes ||W_dec^T W_dec - I||_F^2, we enforce decoder vectors to form an orthogonal basis, theoretically preventing feature superposition and encouraging alignment with natural feature axes in activation space. This differs from prior work focusing on activation functions or sparsity patterns by directly constraining the learned feature geometry. For SCR/TPP benchmarks, orthogonal features should enable cleaner concept isolation - ablating gender-related directions (nearly orthogonal to profession directions) would minimally impact profession classification accuracy. The constrained geometry also prevents accidental cancellation of ablated features through interference with remaining directions, a key failure mode in standard SAEs.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

By adding a regularization term that minimizes ||W_dec^T W_dec - I||_F^2, we enforce decoder vectors to form an orthogonal basis, theoretically preventing feature superposition and encouraging alignment with natural feature axes in activation space. This differs from prior work focusing on activation functions or sparsity patterns by directly constraining the learned feature geometry. For SCR/TPP benchmarks, orthogonal features should enable cleaner concept isolation - ablating gender-related directions (nearly orthogonal to profession directions) would minimally impact profession classification accuracy.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed.

reasoning_content is Okay, so I need to come up with a new idea for improving sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to address polysemanticity and improve performance on the SCR and TPP benchmarks. Let me start by understanding the problem again.

The core issue is polysemanticity in SAE latents, where a single feature represents multiple concepts. This makes it hard to interpret the model's internals. The SCR and TPP benchmarks measure how well the SAE can isolate features so that ablating certain latents removes spurious correlations (SCR) or affects only the targeted concept (TPP). 

Looking at existing ideas, there's been work on adaptive sparsity, gated architectures, batch-level sparsity, activation functions like JumpReLU, clustering, mutual regularization, and switch layers. The Matryoshka SAE example uses nested dictionaries to encourage hierarchical features. But maybe there's another angle to enforce feature disentanglement more directly.

What if we could structure the SAE's latent space to encourage orthogonality between features? If features are orthogonal, they are less likely to overlap semantically, reducing polysemanticity. But how to implement this?

Orthogonal regularization has been used in other contexts to prevent redundancy in neural networks. Applying this to SAEs might help. But SAEs already use sparsity, so combining sparsity with orthogonality could be powerful. However, standard orthogonal regularization might conflict with sparsity. Maybe a dynamic approach that applies orthogonality constraints only to active features.

Another thought: feature hierarchy. Concepts often have hierarchical relationships (e.g., animal → mammal → dog). If the SAE can capture such hierarchies, higher-level features could be more monosemantic. But how to structure the SAE to learn this hierarchy without manual intervention?

Wait, the Matryoshka SAE uses nested dictionaries, but maybe we can add a hierarchical penalty that enforces higher-level features to be composed of lower-level ones. Or use a tree structure in the latent space. But that might complicate training.

Alternatively, using a contrastive loss to push different features apart in the latent space. For example, for each batch, minimize the cosine similarity between different features' activation vectors. This could encourage features to be distinct. But contrastive learning requires careful sampling of positive/negative pairs, which might be tricky here.

Another angle: disentangled representation learning. Techniques like beta-VAE add a penalty on the KL divergence to encourage factorized latent variables. Translating this to SAEs, maybe add a term that penalizes the mutual information between features. But how to compute that efficiently.

Wait, the SCR benchmark involves removing spurious correlations by ablating specific latents. If the SAE's features are more disentangled, ablating gender-related features should affect only gender probes, not profession. So, for SCR, the key is having features that cleanly separate concepts. Similarly for TPP, where ablating a concept's features should only affect its probe.

So, the idea is to modify the SAE training to include a disentanglement-promoting loss term. For example, a penalty on the covariance between features, encouraging them to be decorrelated. This is similar to orthogonal regularization but applied to the latent activations rather than the weights.

Specifically, during training, compute the covariance matrix of the latent activations across a batch and penalize the off-diagonal terms. This would encourage features to activate independently, reducing overlap. Combined with sparsity, this might lead to more monosemantic features.

But how to implement this efficiently. The covariance matrix for d_sae features is d_sae x d_sae, which could be expensive for large dictionaries. Maybe use a stochastic approximation or only penalize the top correlated pairs each batch.

Also, consider that sparsity already reduces the number of active features, so the covariance penalty would focus on the active ones. Maybe normalize the covariance by the number of active features to prevent the penalty from diminishing as sparsity increases.

Another consideration: the SAE's decoder weights. If the decoder vectors are orthogonal, the features they decode are less likely to interfere. So maybe apply orthogonal constraints to the decoder weights. But the existing code already uses a constrained optimizer for the decoder weights, normalizing them. Maybe adding an additional orthogonality penalty on the decoder matrix could help.

But the current code uses a ConstrainedAdam that normalizes the decoder weights to have unit norm. Orthogonality is a stricter condition. Enforcing full orthogonality might be too restrictive, but encouraging it via a regularization term could be feasible.

Putting this together, the proposed SAE variant could include two modifications:

1. A feature covariance penalty term in the loss function to decorrelate latent activations.
2. An orthogonality regularization on the decoder weights to ensure they represent distinct directions.

This combination would encourage both the activations and the decoder weights to be more orthogonal, leading to less entangled features. For SCR and TPP, this should result in features that are more cleanly separated, allowing precise ablation and better disentanglement metrics.

Now, considering implementation: modifying the loss function to include the covariance penalty. For each batch, compute the latent activations' covariance, subtract the diagonal, take the Frobenius norm, and add it to the loss with a scaling factor. For the decoder, add a term that penalizes the dot product between different decoder weight vectors.

But the decoder weights are already normalized. So their dot product is the cosine similarity. Penalizing this would push them towards orthogonality. The covariance term on activations would push for statistical independence.

Potential challenges: balancing the additional regularization terms with the existing sparsity and reconstruction losses. The hyperparameters for the new terms would need tuning. Also, computational overhead from computing the covariance matrix, especially for large d_sae.

In terms of code changes, the SAE's loss function in the CustomTrainer's loss method would need to compute these new terms. The decoder regularization can be added as a term in the loss, perhaps using torch.linalg.norm on the decoder weight matrix multiplied by its transpose minus the identity matrix.

Testing this would involve training SAEs with these new terms and evaluating on SCR and TPP. If successful, the modified SAEs should show higher S_SHIFT and S_TPP scores, indicating better disentanglement.

Now, let's structure this into the JSON format with all required fields.
content is THOUGHT:
The key insight is that polysemanticity arises from features overlapping in activation space. By enforcing orthogonality in both latent activations and decoder weights, we can reduce feature entanglement. The proposed OrthoSAE introduces two novel regularization terms: 1) A feature covariance penalty that minimizes correlation between active latents, addressing activation-space superposition, and 2) A decoder orthogonality constraint that ensures decoded features span orthogonal directions. This dual approach directly targets the geometric causes of polysemanticity while maintaining reconstruction capability. Unlike previous work that focused on sparsity patterns or architectural changes, this method explicitly shapes the latent space geometry to match the theoretical requirements for feature disentanglement. For SCR/TPP benchmarks, orthogonal features should enable cleaner concept isolation - ablating gender features won't accidentally remove profession-related directions due to improved angular separation in the latent space.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

By enforcing orthogonality in both latent activations and decoder weights, we can reduce feature entanglement. The proposed OrthoSAE introduces two novel regularization terms: 1) A feature covariance penalty that minimizes correlation between active latents, addressing activation-space superposition, and 2) A decoder orthogonality constraint that ensures decoded features span orthogonal directions. This dual approach directly targets the geometric causes of polysemanticity while maintaining reconstruction capability. Unlike previous work that focused on sparsity patterns or architectural changes, this method explicitly shapes the latent space geometry to match the theoretical requirements for feature disentanglement.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed.

reasoning_content is Okay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to come up with a novel SAE variant that improves interpretability, specifically targeting the SCR and TPP benchmarks. The existing ideas have explored various approaches like adaptive computation, gating mechanisms, batch-level sparsity, and clustering. 

First, I need to understand the core issues with current SAEs. The main problem is polysemanticity, where a single latent represents multiple concepts. This makes it hard to isolate features for tasks like SCR and TPP. The benchmarks measure how well we can remove spurious correlations (SCR) and how precisely ablating latents affects specific classes (TPP). So, the key is to design an SAE that forces features to be more monosemantic.

Looking at the existing ideas, many focus on sparsity and reconstruction efficiency. However, none explicitly enforce semantic separation in the latent space. Maybe introducing a contrastive loss could help. Contrastive learning encourages similar inputs to have similar representations and dissimilar ones to be different. Applying this to SAE latents might push features to represent distinct concepts.

Wait, but how to apply contrastive loss here? SAEs reconstruct activations, so maybe during training, we can sample pairs of inputs that are semantically related and unrelated. For each input, the SAE's latents should activate differently for different concepts. For example, if two inputs share a concept (like gender), their corresponding latent activations should be similar, while differing from inputs with other concepts.

Alternatively, using a supervised signal to guide the SAE. If we have labeled data (like gender and profession in SCR), we could incorporate auxiliary classification tasks. But the challenge is that SAEs are typically unsupervised. Maybe a semi-supervised approach where the SAE is trained with an additional loss that encourages latents to align with known concepts.

Another angle: disentanglement. Disentangled representations have features that correspond to independent factors of variation. If the SAE can disentangle concepts like gender and profession, then SCR and TPP would naturally improve. Techniques from disentanglement literature, like β-VAE, could be adapted. However, VAE-based methods might not fit the SAE framework directly.

Wait, the SAE already uses a sparsity penalty. Adding a disentanglement penalty might help. For example, encouraging statistical independence between latents. But how? Maybe through a penalty term based on the covariance matrix of the latents, pushing them towards orthogonality or lower mutual information.

Or, using a modular approach. Design the SAE such that groups of latents are responsible for specific concepts. For SCR, if gender-related latents are grouped together, ablating them would more effectively remove the spurious correlation. But how to enforce such grouping without supervision?

Hmm. Maybe a hybrid approach: combine contrastive learning with sparsity. For each batch, identify pairs of examples that share a concept (using existing probes or weak supervision) and enforce that their latent activations for that concept are similar, while other latents remain sparse. This would require some way to get concept labels, which might be feasible using the existing datasets for SCR/TPP.

Wait, the SCR benchmark uses datasets with known spurious correlations (like Bias in Bios). If during SAE training, we have access to these labels, we can use them to guide the latent space. For example, add a loss term that maximizes the mutual information between certain latents and the target concept, while minimizing it for spurious ones. This could encourage the SAE to separate features into distinct groups.

But the challenge is that SAEs are usually trained on general text data, not the specific benchmark datasets. However, if the SAE is trained on the same data used in SCR/TPP, incorporating the label information might be possible. Alternatively, use weak supervision by training simple probes during SAE training to identify concept-related features and guide the latent space.

Another thought: hierarchical SAEs. If features are organized hierarchically, maybe the higher-level concepts (like gender) are separated from lower-level ones (profession). But how to structure this hierarchy without prior knowledge?

Alternatively, use a masking mechanism. During training, randomly mask certain concepts and enforce that the SAE can reconstruct the activation only using the remaining latents. This might encourage redundancy and separation of concepts. But implementing this requires knowing which latents correspond to which concepts, which is the original problem.

Wait, perhaps a multi-task SAE. Train the SAE not only to reconstruct activations but also to predict concept labels (like gender and profession) from the latents. This would push the latents to encode these concepts in a way that linear probes can easily detect, which aligns with the SCR/TPP metrics. However, adding auxiliary tasks might complicate training and require labeled data.

But the SCR and TPP benchmarks themselves rely on linear probes. If the SAE is trained with an auxiliary loss that encourages linear separability of concepts in the latent space, then the resulting latents would naturally perform better on these benchmarks. For example, adding a term that minimizes the cross-entropy loss of linear classifiers trained on the latents for the target concepts.

This approach could work. The SAE would have two objectives: reconstruct the original activations and make the latents linearly separable for certain concepts. The linear classifiers (probes) can be trained online during SAE training, similar to how some semi-supervised methods work. This way, the SAE is incentivized to separate features into distinct, interpretable directions that align with the target concepts, reducing polysemanticity.

But how to implement this without overfitting to the specific concepts? The SAE should still learn a general representation, not just the labeled concepts. Maybe the auxiliary loss is only applied to a subset of the data where labels are available, or use a multi-task setup where the main loss is reconstruction and the auxiliary losses are for specific concepts.

In the context of the provided code, the SAE is trained on activations from a language model. To incorporate the auxiliary loss, during training, we would need access to the labels (like gender and profession) for the input texts. The Bias in Bios dataset has these labels, so perhaps during SAE training, we can sample from this dataset and compute the auxiliary loss based on the labels.

However, the original SAE training uses a general text corpus (like the Pile). Mixing in the Bias in Bios data might limit the generality. Alternatively, train the SAE on the general corpus first, then fine-tune with the auxiliary loss on the specific dataset. But this could lead to overfitting.

Alternatively, use the probes as part of the training process. After each forward pass, train a linear probe on the latents to predict the concept, and then backpropagate the probe loss into the SAE. But this is computationally expensive as it requires training probes on-the-fly.

Wait, but in the SCR benchmark, they use probes to select latents. If during SAE training, we can pre-train these probes and use their gradients to guide the SAE, that might help. For example, freeze the probe weights and use their attributions to adjust the SAE's latent activations. But integrating this into the SAE training loop would require careful design.

Another angle: modify the sparsity penalty to be concept-aware. Instead of a global L1 penalty, apply higher sparsity penalties to latents that are correlated with multiple concepts. But detecting such correlations during training is non-trivial.

Alternatively, use a disentanglement penalty term. For example, minimize the mutual information between groups of latents. This would require estimating mutual information, which can be challenging in high dimensions.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach: orthogonal regularization on the decoder weights. If the decoder vectors are orthogonal, each latent corresponds to a unique direction, reducing overlap. This could reduce polysemanticity. The existing code already uses a constrained Adam optimizer that normalizes decoder weights. Maybe enhancing this with an explicit orthogonality loss.

But orthogonal decoder weights might not directly translate to monosemantic features, as the activations could still combine multiple concepts. However, it's a known technique in dictionary learning to encourage orthogonality for better feature separation.

Putting this together, the idea is to modify the SAE training objective to include an orthogonality constraint on the decoder matrix, along with the standard reconstruction and sparsity losses. This would encourage each latent to correspond to a unique, non-overlapping direction in the activation space, thereby reducing polysemanticity.

Another possibility: use a grouped sparsity penalty. Group latents into predefined or learned groups (e.g., by concept) and apply sparsity at the group level. This would encourage entire groups to activate together, but requires knowing the groups in advance, which isn't feasible without supervision.

Alternatively, dynamic sparsity. Allow the SAE to adjust the sparsity level per latent based on the input, encouraging certain latents to fire only for specific concepts. But implementing this requires a way to dynamically adjust the threshold, which complicates training.

Wait, the Matryoshka SAE idea uses nested dictionaries to capture features at different scales. Maybe combining this with concept-specific groupings. For example, have a hierarchy where higher-level concepts are in the earlier, more general latents, and specific features in later ones. But integrating this with the SCR/TPP benchmarks would require the higher-level latents to correspond to the target concepts.

Alternatively, a multi-head SAE, where different subsets of latents are responsible for different concepts. Each head could be trained with an auxiliary loss for a specific concept. But this requires knowing the concepts in advance, which might not be generalizable.

Back to the original problem: improving SCR and TPP. SCR requires that ablating gender-related latents removes the spurious correlation without hurting profession classification. If the SAE's latents for gender are well-separated, this ablation would be more effective. Similarly, TPP requires that ablating a class's latents only affects that class's probe.

Therefore, the key is to ensure that each latent is strongly associated with a single concept. To achieve this, the SAE training should encourage latents to be maximally informative about individual concepts and minimally about others.

This suggests a mutual information maximization approach. Maximize the mutual information between each latent and a target concept, while minimizing it for others. However, without labeled data, this is challenging. But in the SCR/TPP setup, the concepts are known (gender, profession), so perhaps during SAE training, incorporate these labels to guide feature learning.

So, the idea is to train the SAE with an additional loss term that uses concept labels (when available) to encourage latents to align with specific concepts. For example, add a term that maximizes the correlation between certain latents and the target concept, while minimizing correlation with spurious ones.

This could be implemented by adding linear probes during training. For each batch, train a linear probe on the latents to predict the concept, and add the probe's loss (e.g., cross-entropy) to the SAE's objective. This way, the SAE is incentivized to make the latents linearly separable for the target concepts, which should improve SCR and TPP scores.

But how to handle multiple concepts? Maybe train multiple probes, one for each concept, and sum their losses. However, this could lead to conflicting gradients. Alternatively, use a multi-task setup where each latent is associated with a specific concept.

Wait, but the SAE is supposed to learn features unsupervised. If we have concept labels, this becomes semi-supervised. However, the SCR and TPP benchmarks assume that the SAE is trained without access to these specific labels, as the evaluation is on how well it disentangles them post-hoc.

Therefore, using the concept labels during SAE training might not be feasible in a real-world scenario where the SAE is applied to new concepts. However, for the purpose of optimizing the benchmark, it's acceptable. But this could be seen as overfitting to the benchmark rather than a general solution.

Alternatively, use the concept labels only during evaluation, not training. But then how to improve the SAE's performance? The SAE needs to naturally learn disentangled features without supervision.

Hmm. Maybe instead of using labels, use some form of self-supervision. For example, for each input, extract pairs of tokens that share a concept (e.g., same profession but different gender) and enforce that their latents for that concept are similar. This would require a way to generate such pairs without labels, which might be possible using clustering or pretrained models.

Alternatively, use the internal activations of the language model itself as a signal. For example, if certain attention heads or MLP layers are known to activate for specific concepts, use their outputs as pseudo-labels to guide the SAE.

But this complicates the setup. Perhaps a simpler approach is needed.

Going back to the original SAE architecture, the main components are the encoder, decoder, sparsity penalty, and reconstruction loss. To improve interpretability, the modification should target the learning dynamics to avoid feature absorption and encourage monosemanticity.

One possible modification is to use a combination of local and global sparsity. Local sparsity (per-example) ensures that each input activates few latents, while global sparsity (across the dataset) ensures that each latent is activated by a diverse set of inputs. This could prevent feature absorption by encouraging latents to fire on different subsets of data.

This idea is similar to the BatchTopK approach, which enforces sparsity across the batch. However, combining per-example and batch-level sparsity might help. For example, use TopK per example and also enforce that each latent is used evenly across the batch. This would prevent certain latents from being overused (which could lead to polysemanticity) and others underused.

Implementing this would require a loss term that penalizes the variance in latent usage across the batch. For example, compute the mean activation of each latent over the batch and add a penalty for high variance. This encourages each latent to be used consistently, potentially reducing overlap.

Another idea is to use a diversity penalty on the decoder weights. For example, maximize the cosine similarity between decoder vectors to ensure they are spread out in the activation space. This is similar to orthogonal regularization but focuses on diversity rather than strict orthogonality.

Alternatively, use a competitive activation mechanism. Latents compete to activate for a given input, with a penalty for overlapping activations. This could be implemented by a softmax over the latents, but that would enforce a single active latent, which is too restrictive. Instead, a sparsity penalty that increases when multiple latents activate for the same input.

Wait, but the standard L1 penalty already encourages sparsity. Maybe the issue is that the current penalty doesn't account for which latents are firing together. A grouped L1 penalty that applies higher penalties to groups of latents that often co-activate could discourage polysemanticity. However, defining the groups is non-trivial.

Alternatively, use a contrastive loss between latents. For each active latent, push its activation to be dissimilar from others. This could encourage each latent to capture unique features.

Hmm. Maybe the key is to modify the activation function or the sparsity penalty to discourage overlapping features. For example, a modified ReLU that not only enforces sparsity but also penalizes correlations between latent activations.

Another angle: during training, periodically check for polysemantic latents using automated methods (like clustering their activation contexts) and split them into multiple latents. This would require an online clustering step, which could be computationally expensive but might lead to more monosemantic features.

But integrating this into the training loop would complicate the implementation. However, the existing code already includes a resampling step for dead neurons. Maybe extend this to detect and split polysemantic neurons.

For example, during training, compute the variance in the contexts where a latent activates. If a latent activates in diverse contexts (indicating polysemanticity), split it into two latents. This would require a way to measure context diversity and modify the SAE architecture dynamically, which is challenging but feasible.

Putting this together, the idea is to augment the SAE training with a dynamic splitting mechanism for polysemantic latents. This would involve:

1. Monitoring latent activations for diversity in their triggering contexts.
2. Identifying polysemantic latents using clustering or variance metrics.
3. Splitting these latents into multiple, more monosemantic ones.
4. Adjusting the SAE's parameters accordingly.

This approach directly targets polysemanticity by actively decomposing complex features into simpler ones. However, implementing this would require significant changes to the training loop and efficient detection methods.

Considering the feasibility, the resampling step in the existing code (for dead neurons) could be adapted. Instead of just reinitializing dead neurons, we could split active but polysemantic ones. The main challenges are defining a robust polysemanticity metric and efficiently modifying the SAE's weights.

In terms of the benchmarks, if the SAE's latents are more monosemantic, then ablating gender-related latents in SCR would more precisely remove the spurious signal, improving the SHIFT score. Similarly, in TPP, ablating class-specific latents would have a targeted effect, increasing the TPP score.

Another possible idea is to use attention mechanisms in the SAE. By allowing the SAE to attend to different parts of the input activation, it might learn to focus on specific features, reducing polysemanticity. However, adding attention would increase computational cost and complexity.

Alternatively, use a mixture of experts (MoE) approach within the SAE. Each expert could specialize in a different type of feature, and a gating network routes activations to the relevant experts. This is similar to the Switch SAE idea but with a focus on feature types rather than computational efficiency.

But MoE models are harder to train and might not directly address polysemanticity. The experts could still learn overlapping features unless properly regularized.

Considering all these possibilities, the most feasible and novel approach that directly targets polysemanticity is introducing a contrastive loss into the SAE training. This would encourage latents to activate distinctly for different concepts without requiring labeled data. Here's how it could work:

For each input activation, generate a perturbed version (e.g., by adding noise or masking parts). The SAE should produce similar latent representations for the original and perturbed inputs, but different from other inputs in the batch. This contrastive loss would encourage the latents to capture stable, invariant features, reducing polysemanticity by making features more consistent.

However, generating meaningful perturbations for language model activations is non-trivial. Alternatively, use natural pairs from the dataset. For example, consecutive tokens or sentences with similar context. The contrastive loss would then pull their latent representations closer, while pushing others apart. This might help the SAE learn features that are consistent across related contexts, reducing polysemanticity.

Implementing this would involve modifying the SAE's loss function to include a contrastive term. For each input x_i, sample a positive pair x_j (related) and negatives x_k. The loss would minimize the distance between latent_i and latent_j while maximizing the distance to latent_k. This could be done using a contrastive loss like NT-Xent.

But integrating this into the SAE training requires careful balancing with the reconstruction and sparsity losses. Additionally, it might increase computational cost due to processing multiple samples per input.

Another angle: instead of contrastive loss, use a similarity constraint between latent activations of the same concept. For example, if two inputs have the same gender label, their gender-related latents should be similar. This requires concept labels but could be applied during training on the Bias in Bios dataset.

This approach directly targets the SCR benchmark by ensuring gender features are grouped in specific latents. The SAE would learn to encode gender in a subset of latents, making their ablation more effective. However, this is a supervised approach and may not generalize to other concepts.

Given the constraints of the problem (improving SCR and TPP without assuming labeled data during SAE training), the best approach might be to modify the SAE's architecture or training objective to inherently encourage feature disentanglement. 

A promising direction is to use a combination of orthogonality constraints on the decoder weights and a diversity penalty on the latent activations. This would push each latent to represent a unique, non-overlapping feature, reducing polysemanticity.

Orthogonal decoder weights ensure that each latent's reconstruction direction is independent, preventing feature superposition. A diversity penalty (e.g., encouraging equal usage of latents across the dataset) would prevent feature absorption and promote coverage of different concepts.

Implementing this would involve adding two loss terms: one for decoder orthogonality and another for latent usage diversity. The orthogonality loss can be the Frobenius norm of W_dec.T @ W_dec minus the identity matrix, encouraging orthogonality. The diversity loss could be the negative entropy of the latent activation frequencies, encouraging all latents to be used equally.

Combining these with the standard reconstruction and sparsity losses would result in an SAE with more orthogonal, diverse features, which should improve interpretability on SCR and TPP.

Testing this hypothesis would involve modifying the SAE's loss function in the code, adding the orthogonality and diversity terms. The implementation is feasible within the existing code structure, as it mainly requires adding new loss components. The orthogonality loss can be computed as torch.norm(torch.mm(ae.W_dec.T, ae.W_dec) - torch.eye(ae.d_sae), p='fro'), and the diversity loss as the negative of the entropy of the average activations across the batch.

This approach is novel compared to existing ideas, which focus on sparsity mechanisms or architectural changes but not on decoder orthogonality and latent diversity. By directly targeting the structure of the decoder and the distribution of latent activations, this method could reduce polysemanticity and improve feature separation, leading to better performance on SCR and TPP.
content is THOUGHT:
The proposed Orthogonal Diversity SAE (OD-SAE) addresses polysemanticity through two key mechanisms: orthogonal decoder weights to prevent feature superposition and a diversity penalty to ensure balanced latent usage. By enforcing orthogonality in the decoder matrix (W_dec), each latent's reconstruction direction becomes independent, reducing feature entanglement. The diversity loss, calculated as the negative entropy of latent activation frequencies, prevents feature absorption by encouraging equal utilization of all latents across the dataset. This dual approach directly targets the root causes of polysemanticity - superposition and imbalanced feature activation - leading to more interpretable, monosemantic features. Unlike previous approaches that focus on sparsity mechanisms or architectural changes, OD-SAE explicitly shapes the geometric structure of the learned feature space. This should improve SCR scores by creating cleaner concept separations (e.g., distinct gender vs. profession features) and enhance TPP by ensuring class-specific features are isolated in orthogonal directions.

Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally.

These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods.

Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

Instead of enforcing a fixed number of active latents per sample, BatchTopK selects the top activations across the entire batch. This allows for variable sparsity per sample, with some samples using more latents and others using fewer. The method introduces a batch dependency during training, which is addressed during inference by estimating a global threshold parameter. This threshold is calculated as the average of minimum positive activation values across multiple batches. The SAE is trained on language model activations (e.g., from the residual stream) using a large text corpus. The loss function combines L2 reconstruction error with an L0 sparsity penalty. Experiments were conducted on GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B models, using dictionary sizes of 3072, 6144, 12288, and 24576, with a bandwidth parameter of 0.001 and the Adam optimizer (learning rate 3e-4).", "Research_Impact": "A significant challenge in mechanistic interpretability is developing methods to effectively analyze and interpret the internal representations of large language models. BatchTopK SAEs address this challenge by providing a more flexible and efficient way to compress and represent model activations. By allowing variable sparsity per sample, BatchTopK can potentially capture more nuanced and diverse activation patterns compared to fixed-sparsity methods.

By enforcing orthogonality in the decoder matrix (W_dec), each latent\'s reconstruction direction becomes independent, reducing feature entanglement. The diversity loss, calculated as the negative entropy of latent activation frequencies, prevents feature absorption by encouraging equal utilization of all latents across the dataset. This dual approach directly targets the root causes of polysemanticity - superposition and imbalanced feature activation - leading to more interpretable, monosemantic features. Unlike previous approaches that focus on sparsity mechanisms or architectural changes, OD-SAE explicitly shapes the geometric structure of the learned feature space.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

reasoning_content is Okay, let me try to come up with a new idea for improving sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to address the SCR and TPP benchmarks. The main problem is polysemanticity, where latent features represent multiple concepts, making them less interpretable. Existing approaches like Matryoshka SAE or Gated SAE have their own methods, but maybe there's another angle.

Hmm, the SCR benchmark requires isolating spurious correlations so that ablating certain latents removes one concept without affecting others. TPP needs disentangled latents where ablating a set only affects one class probe. So, the key is to enforce that each latent is as monosemantic as possible.

I remember that in traditional machine learning, techniques like orthogonality constraints can help in disentangling representations. Maybe applying orthogonality to the SAE's decoder weights could help. If the decoder vectors are orthogonal, each latent might be forced to represent distinct, non-overlapping features. This could reduce polysemanticity because overlapping directions in the activation space would be minimized.

Another thought: if the decoder matrix has orthogonal columns, then each feature's contribution to the reconstruction is independent. This might prevent features from absorbing multiple concepts since their reconstruction components can't interfere. So, adding an orthogonality regularization term to the decoder weights during training might encourage more distinct features.

But how exactly to implement this? Maybe add a term to the loss function that penalizes non-orthogonal decoder weights. The regularization could be something like the Frobenius norm of W_dec^T W_dec minus the identity matrix. That would push the columns of W_dec to be orthogonal.

Wait, but SAEs already have a sparsity penalty (L1) on the activations. Combining that with an orthogonality constraint on the decoder might lead to features that are both sparse and non-redundant. This could reduce feature absorption because features can't share overlapping directions as much, making them more likely to split into separate concepts instead of merging.

For the experiments, modify the SAE's loss function to include the orthogonality regularization. Then, train on the same datasets and compare SCR and TPP scores against baseline SAEs. If the orthogonality helps, the ablation should more precisely remove spurious signals, improving SCR's S_SHIFT and TPP's S_TPP.

Implementation-wise, in the CustomSAE class, the decoder weights W_dec are a parameter. In the trainer's loss function, compute the regularization term as ||W_dec.T @ W_dec - I||_F^2, scaled by a hyperparameter. Add this term to the existing loss (reconstruction + L1). Adjust the optimizer to handle the new term.

Potential challenges: tuning the regularization strength. Too strong might hinder reconstruction, too weak won't help. Also, ensuring that the orthogonality constraint doesn't conflict with the sparsity objective. Need to experiment with different weights for the regularization term.

But how does this differ from existing ideas? The existing ideas like adaptive sparsity or gating focus on activation functions or architecture changes. Orthogonality regularization on the decoder is a different approach, targeting the weight matrix directly to enforce feature independence. This hasn't been explored much in SAEs for interpretability, as far as I know.

For the benchmarks, SCR would benefit because orthogonal features mean that ablating gender-related latents would leave profession-related ones untouched, leading to better debiasing. Similarly, TPP's class-specific ablation would be more effective if each latent is tied to a single concept. So the hypothesis is that orthogonality improves disentanglement, hence better scores on SCR and TPP.

So the new idea is Orthogonal Sparse Autoencoders, adding orthogonality regularization to the decoder weights. Let's structure this into the JSON format with all required fields.
content is THOUGHT:
Orthogonal regularization of decoder weights directly targets feature entanglement by enforcing directional independence in the reconstruction basis. Unlike prior approaches that modify activation functions or sparsity patterns, this structural constraint on the decoder matrix should prevent features from sharing overlapping semantic directions in activation space. By minimizing ||W_dec^T W_dec - I||, we create an overcomplete basis where each latent must explain unique variance, reducing opportunities for polysemantic combinations. This should improve SCR/TPP scores by ensuring spurious correlations map to distinct, ablatable directions rather than being distributed across correlated features. Implementation is straightforward via an added loss term, avoiding complex architectural changes.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed.

reasoning_content is Okay, so I need to come up with a new idea for improving sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to address the problem of polysemanticity and improve interpretability, especially for the SCR and TPP benchmarks. Let me start by understanding the problem again. The key issue is that individual latent features in SAEs often represent multiple concepts (polysemanticity), making it hard to interpret what each feature does. The benchmarks SCR and TPP measure how well the SAE can isolate features so that ablating certain latents removes spurious correlations (SCR) or affects only specific classes (TPP).

Looking at existing ideas, there's adaptive sparsity, gated architectures, batch-level sparsity, etc. The Matryoshka SAE example uses nested dictionaries to encourage hierarchical features. But how can I build on this or find a new angle?

Hmm, maybe hierarchical decomposition? If features are organized hierarchically, then higher-level features could be combinations of lower-level ones, which might reduce polysemanticity. Wait, but the Matryoshka idea already does something similar with nested dictionaries.

Alternatively, what if we enforce a structure in the latent space that discourages polysemanticity? For example, using a contrastive loss to make features more distinct. But how to integrate that into SAE training?

Another angle: The SCR benchmark requires features to be separable by concept. If we can cluster features into groups that correspond to distinct concepts, then ablation would be more precise. Maybe a group sparsity penalty? Or a modular architecture where each group of features is responsible for a different concept.

Wait, group sparsity. If we structure the SAE's latent space into groups and apply sparsity at the group level, maybe each group can capture a distinct concept. This could reduce feature absorption because groups are encouraged to activate together for related concepts, while staying silent otherwise. For example, a group for gender-related features and another for profession-related features. Then, during SCR evaluation, ablating the entire gender group would remove spurious correlations more effectively.

But how to implement group sparsity in SAEs? Typically, SAEs use L1 regularization on individual activations. Group sparsity would involve penalties on the L2 norm of groups, promoting entire groups to be inactive unless needed. So modifying the loss function to include a group Lasso term.

So the idea is Group Sparse Autoencoders (GSAEs). The technical details would involve defining groups (maybe through some prior knowledge or learned structure), and adding a group sparsity penalty. But how to define the groups without supervision? Maybe using an unsupervised clustering of features during training. Alternatively, using a fixed number of groups and learning their assignments.

Alternatively, use a hierarchical structure where groups are nested or overlapping. But that might complicate things. Maybe start with fixed, non-overlapping groups. The challenge is defining groups without prior knowledge. Perhaps use a learnable grouping mechanism where features are assigned to groups dynamically based on their activations.

Wait, but that could be complex. Maybe a simpler approach: divide the latent dimensions into fixed groups (e.g., 16 groups of 64 features each) and apply group sparsity. The loss would include both individual L1 and group L2 penalties. This way, within a group, features can specialize, but the group as a whole is encouraged to be sparse. This might lead to groups capturing more coherent concepts, reducing polysemanticity within each group.

For the SCR benchmark, if a group corresponds to a concept like gender, then ablating that group would remove gender-related features more effectively, leading to higher debiasing accuracy. Similarly, for TPP, groups could align with class-specific features, so ablating a group affects only its corresponding class.

But how to ensure that groups align with meaningful concepts without supervision? Maybe the combination of group sparsity and individual sparsity would encourage features within a group to be related. The group penalty pushes for fewer active groups per input, while individual sparsity within groups refines the features. This hierarchical sparsity might lead to more interpretable groupings.

Implementation-wise, modify the SAE's loss function to include a group sparsity term. For example, after the ReLU activation, compute the L2 norm of each group and sum those norms multiplied by a group sparsity coefficient. The total loss would be reconstruction loss + λ1 * individual L1 + λ2 * group L1 (sum of group L2 norms).

In the code, during the forward pass, after computing the activations, split them into groups, compute the group norms, and add the penalty. The groups can be defined as a hyperparameter (e.g., group_size). The trainer would need to handle the new loss components.

Potential challenges: Choosing the right group size and balancing the coefficients λ1 and λ2. Also, training dynamics might be more complex. But given the existing SAE code, modifying the loss function and adding group penalties should be feasible.

For the experiments, compare GSAEs against standard SAEs on SCR and TPP. Measure the SHIFT score and TPP score. If groups capture more coherent concepts, ablating them should lead to higher SHIFT scores (better debiasing) and higher TPP scores (more isolated effects).

Another consideration: How to select groups during ablation. For SCR, instead of selecting individual latents with high probe attribution, select entire groups that the probe deems relevant. This might require a way to score groups, perhaps by aggregating individual feature attributions within a group.

In the implementation plan, modify the CustomSAE's encode method to track groups, adjust the loss in the trainer, and during evaluation, modify the ablation to consider groups. The main code changes would be in the loss computation and possibly the feature selection for ablation in the benchmarks.

Feasibility-wise, the changes are manageable. The SAE code in experiment.py has a loss function in the trainer's loss method. Adding group penalties would require splitting the activations into groups and computing the additional terms. The group structure is a hyperparameter, so the code can be parameterized with group size. Training time might increase slightly due to the added loss terms, but within the 30-minute H100 constraint if the groups are not too large.

Novelty: Group sparsity has been used in other contexts (like group Lasso), but applying it to SAEs for mechanistic interpretability is novel. Existing SAE variants focus on individual sparsity or adaptive sparsity, not group-wise. This approach directly targets the structure of the latent space to reduce polysemanticity, which is different from previous methods.

Research Impact: By enforcing group-wise sparsity, the SAE is encouraged to learn features that are grouped into coherent concepts. This should improve SCR and TPP scores because ablating a group would remove a whole concept, leading to more precise debiasing and class-specific effects. The improved interpretability of groups would make the SAE more effective in unlearning tasks as well, where removing specific knowledge requires targeting the right set of features.

Potential issues: If groups are too large or not properly structured, the approach might not capture meaningful concepts. However, even with fixed groups, the combined sparsity penalties could lead to more monosemantic features within groups. Also, the choice of group size needs experimentation, but that's part of the research process.

In summary, the idea is to introduce group sparsity into SAEs to encourage feature groupings that correspond to distinct concepts, thereby reducing polysemanticity and improving performance on SCR and TPP benchmarks.
content is THOUGHT:
The key insight is that group sparsity constraints can help organize latent features into coherent concept clusters, reducing polysemanticity within groups. By adding structured sparsity through a group L1 penalty (sum of L2 group norms), we encourage the SAE to activate entire feature groups together when needed, while keeping most groups silent. This should create more semantically consistent feature groupings compared to individual sparsity alone. For SCR/TPP benchmarks, ablating entire concept-aligned groups should enable more precise removal of spurious correlations while preserving other signals. Unlike previous approaches that focus on individual feature sparsity or adaptive computation, this explicitly structures the latent space to match human-interpretable concept boundaries.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

By adding structured sparsity through a group L1 penalty (sum of L2 group norms), we encourage the SAE to activate entire feature groups together when needed, while keeping most groups silent. This should create more semantically consistent feature groupings compared to individual sparsity alone. For SCR/TPP benchmarks, ablating entire concept-aligned groups should enable more precise removal of spurious correlations while preserving other signals.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed.

reasoning_content is Okay, I need to come up with a new idea for improving sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to address the problem of polysemanticity and improve performance on the SCR and TPP benchmarks. Let's start by understanding the core issue here. The existing SAEs have features that activate for multiple concepts (polysemanticity), which makes it hard to isolate specific concepts during tasks like spurious correlation removal (SCR) or targeted probe perturbation (TPP). 

The key challenge is to make the latent features more monosemantic. Previous approaches include modifying activation functions (like Gated SAE or JumpReLU), changing sparsity constraints (BatchTopK), or using auxiliary losses (adaptive SAEs). But they might not fully address the root cause of polysemanticity.

Hmm, maybe we can enforce orthogonality in the latent space. If features are orthogonal, they are less likely to overlap in representing different concepts. Orthogonality could reduce feature entanglement, leading to more interpretable and monosemantic features. But how to implement this in SAEs?

Another angle: current SAEs use L1 regularization or TopK for sparsity, but they don't explicitly encourage features to be independent. Adding an orthogonality constraint on the encoder weights might help. For example, adding a term in the loss that minimizes the cosine similarity between different feature vectors in the encoder's weight matrix. That would push the features to be orthogonal, reducing redundancy and overlapping activations.

Wait, but enforcing full orthogonality might be too strict and could hurt reconstruction. Maybe a softer regularization term that encourages features to be as orthogonal as possible without strictly enforcing it. Like adding a penalty based on the Frobenius norm of the encoder weight matrix multiplied by its transpose minus the identity matrix. That would encourage the features to be orthogonal but allow some flexibility.

So the idea is Orthogonal Sparse Autoencoders (OrthoSAE). The technical details would involve modifying the loss function to include an orthogonality regularization term. The loss would be L = reconstruction_loss + λ1 * sparsity_loss + λ2 * ortho_loss. The ortho_loss could be ||W_enc^T W_enc - I||_F^2, where W_enc is the encoder weight matrix. This term encourages the columns of W_enc to be orthogonal.

By doing this, each latent feature's direction in the activation space is more distinct, reducing the chance of multiple concepts being represented by the same or similar features. This should lead to more monosemantic features, which would perform better on SCR and TPP. For SCR, when ablating gender-related features, they would be more distinct from profession features, leading to better accuracy after ablation. Similarly, in TPP, ablating a set of features should affect only the targeted class probes because the features are disentangled.

Now, comparing to existing ideas: The Matryoshka SAE uses nested dictionaries but doesn't address feature orthogonality. The Gated SAE focuses on separating gating and magnitude, which is different. The Mutual Feature Regularization uses auxiliary penalties across SAEs, not within. OrthoSAE's novelty is in directly regularizing the encoder weights for orthogonality.

Implementation-wise, in the SAE code, I need to add the ortho_loss term to the existing loss. Modify the CustomSAE's loss function to compute this term. The encoder weights W_enc are a matrix of size d_in x d_sae. The ortho_loss is calculated as the Frobenius norm of (W_enc.T @ W_enc - I). This is straightforward to implement in PyTorch using torch.norm and matrix multiplication.

In the CustomTrainer's loss method, after computing l2_loss and l1_loss, compute the ortho_loss and add it with a coefficient. The hyperparameters λ1 (sparsity) and λ2 (ortho) need to be tuned. Maybe start with λ2 as a small value to not overpower the main losses.

Experiments would involve training OrthoSAE on the same datasets as baseline SAEs, then evaluating on SCR and TPP. The hypothesis is that OrthoSAE achieves higher S_SHIFT and S_TPP scores because the features are more disentangled.

Potential challenges: Adding the ortho_loss might increase training time slightly due to the additional computation, but it's manageable. Also, finding the right balance between orthogonality and reconstruction is crucial. Too high λ2 could lead to worse reconstruction, but proper tuning should mitigate this.

In terms of feasibility, modifying the loss function in the existing code is straightforward. The ortho_loss term can be computed with a few lines of code. The rest of the training pipeline remains the same. The experiment doesn't require complex architectural changes, so a junior PhD student could implement this within a week. Training time might be similar to the original SAE, as the added computation is minimal.

For the benchmarks, SCR requires that ablating features related to one concept (gender) doesn't affect another (profession). If OrthoSAE's features are more orthogonal, the ablation should more precisely remove the spurious signal, leading to higher accuracy. Similarly, in TPP, ablating class-specific features should only affect that class's probe, improving the TPP score.

In terms of novelty, while orthogonality constraints have been used in other areas of ML (like in autoencoders for disentangled representations), applying them specifically to SAEs in the context of mechanistic interpretability for reducing polysemanticity is a new approach. This addresses the core issue highlighted in the problem statement directly.

So, the proposed OrthoSAE should improve interpretability by enforcing orthogonality in the latent space, leading to better performance on SCR and TPP benchmarks. The implementation is feasible and the idea is novel in this context.
content is THOUGHT:
The key insight is that polysemanticity arises when SAE features capture overlapping directions in activation space. By explicitly enforcing orthogonality constraints in the latent space through a novel orthogonality regularization term, we can encourage features to represent distinct, non-redundant concepts. This differs from prior work focusing on sparsity or activation functions by directly addressing geometric relationships between features. The orthogonality penalty (||W_enc^T W_enc - I||_F^2) applied to encoder weights should create more disentangled representations, improving SCR/TPP scores through better concept isolation. Implementation requires minimal code changes - adding the regularization term to the loss function while maintaining existing sparsity mechanisms.

new_msg_history after appending content is [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Your current research focuses on addressing the challenge of limited interpretability in the latent space of sparse autoencoders. The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed.

reasoning_content is Okay, so I need to come up with a new idea for improving sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to address the problem of polysemanticity and improve performance on the SCR and TPP benchmarks. The existing ideas include things like adaptive computation, gated architectures, BatchTopK, JumpReLU, clustering, mutual regularization, switch layers, and various training improvements. 

Let me think about the core issues here. Polysemanticity means that individual features in the SAE are representing multiple concepts, which makes interpretation hard. The SCR benchmark measures how well the SAE can isolate spurious correlations, like gender and profession, so that removing certain latents effectively debiases the classifier. TPP is about disentangling features so that ablating a set affects only the targeted class.

So, the key is to make the SAE features more monosemantic. How can I modify SAEs to encourage this? Maybe by introducing some kind of structure or constraint that forces features to be more distinct. Existing approaches might not sufficiently enforce separation between features.

Wait, one possible angle is to use contrastive learning. If features are encouraged to be dissimilar from each other, they might capture more distinct concepts. Or maybe adding a penalty for overlapping activations. Another idea is hierarchical decomposition, where features are organized in a hierarchy to prevent absorption. For example, having higher-level features that depend on lower-level ones, which might prevent feature merging.

Alternatively, maybe using a mixture of experts approach where different experts handle different types of features, reducing overlap. But the Switch SAE idea already does something like that. Hmm.

Another angle: during training, explicitly penalize features that activate together too often. This could be done via a covariance penalty on the activations. If two features co-activate frequently, their covariance is high, and the penalty would discourage that. This might reduce polysemanticity by making features more orthogonal.

Or perhaps use a diversity regularization term. For example, the SAE's encoder weights could be regularized to have orthogonal vectors, which would encourage each feature to respond to different directions in the input space. But that's more about the weights, not the activations.

Wait, the SCR and TPP benchmarks require that when you ablate certain features, only the targeted concept is affected. So, the SAE needs to have features that are strongly associated with specific concepts and not others. Maybe the problem is that current SAEs don't explicitly model the relationships between features and concepts, leading to entangled representations.

What if we incorporate some form of supervision during training? Like using labeled data to guide the SAE features to align with known concepts. But the challenge is that in mechanistic interpretability, we usually want unsupervised methods. However, maybe a semi-supervised approach could help, using a small amount of labeled data to encourage feature disentanglement.

Alternatively, using probes during training. If we train probes to predict certain concepts from the SAE features and then regularize the features to be maximally informative for their respective probes while minimizing interference with others. But integrating this into the SAE training loop might complicate things.

Another thought: the way features are activated might be key. If the activation function or sparsity constraint can be adjusted to prevent features from being active in overlapping contexts. For example, using a winner-takes-all mechanism more aggressively, or introducing competition between features.

Wait, the existing Matryoshka SAE idea uses nested autoencoders to have features at different scales. Maybe extending that by having each scale focus on different levels of abstraction, which could reduce feature absorption. But how does that directly address SCR and TPP?

Alternatively, a dynamic sparsity penalty that varies per feature based on their activation patterns. Features that are too correlated with others get a higher penalty, forcing them to specialize.

Hmm. Let me focus on the SCR benchmark. The goal is to remove spurious correlations by ablating specific latents. If the SAE has features that cleanly separate gender and profession, then ablating gender-related features should improve the classifier's accuracy on profession by removing the spurious signal. So, the SAE needs to have distinct, non-overlapping features for these concepts.

To achieve this, maybe during training, the SAE can be encouraged to have features that are maximally informative for one concept while being minimally informative for others. For example, adding a mutual information-based loss term that maximizes MI between features and their intended concepts while minimizing MI with others. But again, this requires labeled data.

Alternatively, an adversarial component where a discriminator tries to predict the spurious concept from the SAE features, and the SAE is trained to fool it. This could help the SAE learn features that do not encode the spurious correlations, making them easier to ablate later. But integrating adversarial training might complicate the SAE's training stability.

Wait, the paper mentioned that the current approach uses probe attribution scores to select features for ablation. If the SAE's features are more aligned with individual concepts, then their probe attribution scores would be more distinct. So, improving the alignment between SAE features and human-interpretable concepts would directly benefit SCR and TPP.

Maybe introducing a loss term that encourages each feature to have high mutual information with a single concept. This could be done using a contrastive loss or by maximizing the feature's contribution to a probe's accuracy for one concept while minimizing it for others. But again, needing labeled data is a problem.

Alternatively, during SAE training, use a multi-task objective where each feature is encouraged to predict a different concept. But without labeled data, this is tricky. Maybe using clustering on the input data to create pseudo-labels for concepts and then using those to guide feature learning. However, that adds complexity.

Another angle: modify the decoder weights. If the decoder is constrained such that each feature's decoder vector is orthogonal to others, this might encourage features to represent distinct directions in the activation space, reducing overlap. This is similar to dictionary learning with incoherence constraints. But SAEs already use tied weights between encoder and decoder, so orthogonal decoder weights might enforce orthogonality in the encoder as well.

Wait, in the standard SAE, the decoder matrix is tied to the encoder (W_dec = W_enc.T), but in some implementations, they are separate. If we enforce orthogonality on the decoder weights, that could make the features more orthogonal, reducing polysemanticity. This might help in SCR and TPP by making features more distinct.

So, the idea is to add an orthogonality constraint on the decoder matrix. For example, adding a regularization term that minimizes the cosine similarity between different decoder vectors. This would push the decoder weights to be orthogonal, which in turn would encourage the encoder to activate features in a way that each captures a unique direction in the input space. This should reduce feature overlap and make the features more monosemantic.

How feasible is this? The modification would involve adding a regularization term to the loss function that penalizes non-orthogonal decoder weights. For example, the loss could include the Frobenius norm of W_dec.T @ W_dec minus the identity matrix, which encourages orthogonality. This is a common technique in dictionary learning and other representation learning methods.

By making the decoder weights more orthogonal, each feature's activation would correspond to a unique direction, reducing the chance that multiple concepts are mixed into a single feature. This should lead to more interpretable features, improving SCR and TPP scores because ablating a set of features would more cleanly remove a specific concept without affecting others.

Another benefit is that orthogonality can help prevent feature absorption. If features are orthogonal, the SAE can't easily absorb one feature into another because their directions are constrained to be dissimilar. This directly addresses the feature absorption problem mentioned in the example, which would improve the feature absorption benchmark as well.

Implementation-wise, this would involve modifying the SAE's loss function to include an orthogonality regularization term. The existing SAE code has a loss that combines L2 reconstruction and L1 sparsity. Adding a term like lambda * ||W_dec.T @ W_dec - I||_F^2 (Frobenius norm) would enforce orthogonality. Alternatively, using a penalty on the off-diagonal elements of W_dec.T @ W_dec to minimize their magnitudes.

However, enforcing strict orthogonality might be challenging, especially with the L1 sparsity term. The optimizer would need to balance reconstruction, sparsity, and orthogonality. But even a soft regularization could help.

So, the proposed idea is Orthogonal Sparse Autoencoders (OrthoSAE), which add an orthogonality constraint on the decoder weights to encourage features to be orthogonal, thereby reducing polysemanticity and improving interpretability. This should lead to better performance on SCR and TPP benchmarks by making features more distinct and less entangled.

Now, evaluating the feasibility. The code modification would involve adding the orthogonality regularization term to the loss function. In the existing code, the loss is computed in the `loss` method of the trainer class. Adding a term like `ortho_loss = torch.norm(torch.mm(ae.W_dec, ae.W_dec.T) - torch.eye(ae.d_sae, device=device)) ** 2` multiplied by a hyperparameter. The main challenge is tuning the regularization strength (lambda) to balance the different loss terms. Also, computing the Frobenius norm might be computationally expensive if the dictionary size is large, but since SAEs typically have d_sae up to tens of thousands, this is manageable on a GPU.

The experiment would involve training SAEs with and without the orthogonality regularization and comparing their SCR and TPP scores. The hypothesis is that OrthoSAE features are more disentangled, leading to higher S_SHIFT and S_TPP.

For the implementation plan: modify the `loss` method in the CustomTrainer to include the orthogonality term. Adjust the hyperparameters (lambda) during training. The rest of the code (data loading, model structure, etc.) remains the same.

Potential issues: if the orthogonality regularization is too strong, it might hurt reconstruction quality. Finding the right balance is key. Also, ensuring that the gradients are properly computed with the new term.

In terms of novelty, using orthogonality constraints in SAEs hasn't been explored in the existing ideas listed. The previous approaches focus on activation functions, architecture changes, or training procedures, but not on the decoder weight structure. This makes the idea novel.

Assessing the research impact: by enforcing orthogonality, features are less likely to overlap, which should improve the precision of feature ablation in SCR and TPP. For SCR, removing gender-related features would more cleanly eliminate that signal without affecting profession, leading to higher accuracy. For TPP, ablating a class's features would only affect that class's probe, improving the TPP score.

Interestingness is high because it's a simple yet potentially effective modification. Feasibility is high since the code change is minimal and the computational overhead manageable. Novelty is good since it's a new constraint not present in existing SAE variants.
content is THOUGHT:
The key insight is that enforcing orthogonality in decoder weights could reduce feature entanglement by preventing latent directions from overlapping in activation space. Current SAEs allow correlated decoder vectors, enabling superposition of concepts in single latents. By adding an orthogonal regularization term to the decoder matrix, we force features to occupy distinct semantic directions, which should: 1) Reduce polysemanticity through directional separation 2) Prevent feature absorption by making hierarchical relationships explicit 3) Improve ablation precision in SCR/TPP by creating cleaner concept-decoder alignments. This differs from prior work focusing on activation functions or architecture changes - here we directly constrain the geometric relationships between learned features. The orthogonality objective is computationally lightweight and integrates seamlessly with existing SAE frameworks.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed.

reasoning_content is Okay, so I need to come up with a new idea for improving sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to address the problem of polysemanticity in the latent space, which affects interpretability. The target benchmarks are SCR and TPP. Let me start by understanding the existing ideas and see where there's a gap.

Looking at the previous ideas: there's adaptive computation with Feature Choice and Mutual Choice, Gated SAE with separate gating and magnitude components, BatchTopK for variable sparsity, JumpReLU activation, clustered SAEs for efficiency, mutual feature regularization, switch SAEs using expert routing, and various training improvements like TopK and Multi-TopK. These all address different aspects like sparsity, reconstruction, efficiency, and feature utilization.

The core issue here is polysemanticity, where a single latent feature represents multiple concepts. Existing solutions might not sufficiently enforce the separation of features. Maybe introducing a contrastive loss could help? Contrastive learning encourages similar inputs to have similar representations and dissimilar ones to be different. If applied to SAEs, it might push the model to separate features more distinctly.

Wait, how would that work in the context of SAEs? The SAE's encoder produces sparse activations. If we add a contrastive loss term, perhaps between different samples or within a sample's features, it might encourage each feature to be more specialized. For example, features that activate for the same concept across different contexts would be pulled together, while features for different concepts are pushed apart. This could reduce polysemanticity by making features more monosemantic.

But how to implement this? The SAE's standard loss is reconstruction plus sparsity. Adding a contrastive term would require defining positive and negative pairs. Maybe using the same input with different perturbations (like dropout) as positive pairs and different inputs as negatives. Alternatively, for each feature, ensuring that when it's active, it's consistently representing the same concept, which might require some supervision or automated labeling.

Alternatively, intra-feature contrastive loss. For each feature, if it activates on a sample, other samples where it's active should be similar in the feature space. But this might be tricky without labels. Maybe leveraging the model's own activations to create pseudo-labels. For example, using the context around a token to determine if the feature should be considered similar.

Another angle: disentangling features by encouraging orthogonality in the decoder weights. If the decoder's weight vectors are more orthogonal, each feature's direction in the activation space is more distinct, reducing overlap. This could be done by adding a regularization term on the decoder weights' cosine similarity.

Or perhaps using a mixture of experts approach where each expert is encouraged to specialize in a specific type of feature. But that's similar to the Switch SAE idea already proposed.

Wait, the problem in SCR and TPP is that when you ablate certain latents, the classifier's performance should only affect the target concept. If the SAE's features are polysemantic, ablating them might remove multiple concepts, leading to lower scores. So, if we can make features more monosemantic, ablation would precisely target the spurious correlation, improving SCR and TPP.

So, the key is to enforce that each latent feature corresponds to a single concept. How to do that without supervision? Maybe using self-supervised signals. For example, in the context of the input text, certain features should activate consistently for the same concept across different contexts.

An idea: Contrastive Sparse Autoencoders. Modify the SAE loss function to include a contrastive term that encourages each feature to activate consistently for the same semantic concept. The contrastive loss would minimize the distance between activations of the same feature across different instances of the same concept and maximize the distance between different features.

But how to define positive and negative pairs without labels? Maybe using the model's own predictions or attention patterns as a proxy. For instance, if two sentences contain the same entity (like "doctor"), their SAE features related to profession should be similar. But entity recognition might require additional processing.

Alternatively, use the context window. For a given token, positive pairs could be other tokens in similar contexts, and negatives are tokens in different contexts. Then, the contrastive loss would push the SAE features to be similar for the same context type.

Another approach: feature-wise contrastive loss. For each feature, when it activates in two different samples, their representations in that feature should be similar. This might encourage the feature to capture a consistent concept. However, without knowing which samples share concepts, this is challenging.

Maybe leveraging the fact that in the SCR benchmark, gender and profession are the spurious correlations. If during training, the SAE can be guided to separate these concepts via contrastive learning on these attributes, even in an unsupervised way, it might help. But that might require some form of weak supervision.

Alternatively, use the existing probes trained on spurious signals (like gender) as a way to generate pseudo-labels. The contrastive loss could then encourage features to align with these probes, making them more concept-specific.

Wait, but the SCR process uses probes to select latents. If during SAE training, we can incorporate the probe's information, perhaps by maximizing the mutual information between certain features and the probe's predictions, that could guide the SAE to have features aligned with the desired concepts.

But integrating that into training might complicate the process. Maybe a two-stage approach: first train the SAE normally, then use the probes to identify relevant features, and retrain with a loss that enforces those features to be more aligned. However, this might not be feasible in an unsupervised setting.

Back to contrastive learning. Let's say we add a term to the loss that for each sample, the active features are encouraged to have minimal overlap with features activated in other samples that are semantically different. But without knowing semantics, how?

Alternatively, using the reconstruction error as a signal. If two samples have similar reconstruction patterns, their active features should be similar. But this might not directly address polysemanticity.

Hmm. Another angle: feature diversity. If the decoder weights are encouraged to be orthogonal, each feature's direction is distinct, reducing the chance of a single feature capturing multiple concepts. Adding an orthogonality regularization term on the decoder weights (W_dec) could help. This is similar to methods used in other autoencoder architectures to prevent redundancy.

Orthogonal regularization has been used in other contexts to improve feature disentanglement. For SAEs, applying it to the decoder weights might push each feature to represent a unique direction in the activation space, thus reducing polysemanticity. This could be implemented as a regularization term that minimizes the cosine similarity between different decoder weight vectors.

So, the technical details would involve modifying the SAE's loss function to include a term that penalizes non-orthogonal decoder weights. The loss would be L = reconstruction_loss + sparsity_loss + λ * orthogonality_loss, where orthogonality_loss is the sum of squared dot products between different decoder weight vectors divided by their norms.

This approach doesn't require additional data or labels, making it feasible. It directly targets the structure of the decoder weights, which are crucial for reconstructing the original activations. If the decoder weights are more orthogonal, each latent feature's contribution to the reconstruction is more distinct, potentially leading to more monosemantic features.

In terms of implementation, the existing SAE code can be modified by adding the orthogonality regularization term. The CustomSAE class's forward pass already computes the reconstruction loss and sparsity. The trainer's loss function would need to include the new regularization term. The orthogonality loss can be computed as the Frobenius norm of W_dec.T @ W_dec minus the identity matrix, which encourages the columns of W_dec to be orthogonal.

For the benchmarks SCR and TPP, more orthogonal features would mean that ablating a set of latents (e.g., gender-related) would more precisely remove that concept without affecting others. This should improve SCR's S_SHIFT score as the ablation is more effective, and TPP's S_TPP by ensuring that ablating a class's latents only affects that class's probe.

Potential challenges include balancing the orthogonality regularization strength (λ) with the other loss terms. Too high a λ might harm reconstruction, while too low might not have an effect. Hyperparameter tuning would be necessary.

Another consideration is that enforcing strict orthogonality might limit the capacity of the SAE, especially if the true underlying features are not orthogonal. However, encouraging near-orthogonality could still help reduce polysemanticity without sacrificing too much reconstruction.

Comparing to existing ideas, this approach is novel because it directly regularizes the decoder weights' structure rather than modifying the activation function or sparsity mechanism. It's a different angle from previous methods like Gated SAE or adaptive sparsity.

The implementation plan would involve modifying the loss function in the CustomTrainer's loss method to include the orthogonality term. The code for the SAE's decoder weights (W_dec) would need to be accessed, and the regularization term computed. The rest of the training loop remains the same. This is feasible as it's a minor code change but could have significant impact.

Feasibility-wise, adding a regularization term is straightforward. The main effort is in coding the orthogonality loss and tuning the λ parameter. Since the existing code already handles the optimizer and training loop, integrating this change should be manageable within a junior PhD student's capabilities and time.

Novelty is moderate since orthogonality constraints are known in other areas, but applying them specifically to SAEs for mechanistic interpretability is new. The impact on SCR and TPP benchmarks could be significant if it reduces polysemanticity, leading to higher scores.
content is THOUGHT:
The key insight is that enforcing orthogonality in decoder weights can reduce feature entanglement by ensuring each latent feature reconstructs along distinct directions in activation space. This directly combats polysemanticity by preventing multiple concepts from being encoded in overlapping feature directions. Unlike previous approaches that modified activation functions or sparsity mechanisms, this targets the fundamental geometric structure of the learned features. By adding an orthogonality regularization term to the decoder weights (W_dec), we incentivize the model to learn more axis-aligned, interpretable features. This should improve SCR/TPP scores by creating cleaner separations between concept-related features, enabling more precise ablation of spurious correlations without collateral damage to other concepts.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed. This incentivizes the initial latents to represent broadly applicable and general features, as they contribute to multiple reconstruction objectives, while later latents can focus on more specific, less frequent features.\n<experiment.py>\nimport torch\nimport os\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom nnsight import LanguageModel\nfrom dictionary_learning.utils import hf_dataset_to_generator\nfrom dictionary_learning.buffer import ActivationBuffer\nimport argparse\n\n\n\n\n\n# Do not modify CustomSAEConfig class as this defines the right format for SAE to be evaluated!\n@dataclass\nclass CustomSAEConfig:\n    model_name: str\n    d_in: int\n    d_sae: int\n    hook_layer: int\n    hook_name: str\n\n    # The following are used for the core/main.py SAE evaluation\n    context_size: int = None  # Can be used for auto-interp\n    hook_head_index: Optional[int] = None\n\n    # Architecture settings\n    architecture: str = ""\n    apply_b_dec_to_input: bool = None\n    finetuning_scaling_factor: bool = None\n    activation_fn_str: str = ""\n    activation_fn_kwargs = {}\n    prepend_bos: bool = True\n    normalize_activations: str = "none"\n\n    # Model settings\n    dtype: str = ""\n    device: str = ""\n    model_from_pretrained_kwargs = {}\n\n    # Dataset settings\n    dataset_path: str = ""\n    dataset_trust_remote_code: bool = True\n    seqpos_slice: tuple = (None,)\n    training_tokens: int = -100_000\n\n    # Metadata\n    sae_lens_training_version: Optional[str] = None\n    neuronpedia_id: Optional[str] = None\n\n# modify the following subclass to implement the proposed SAE variant\n# change the name "CustomSAE" to a appropriate name such as "TemporalSAE" depending on experiment idea\nclass CustomSAE(nn.Module):\n    """Implementation of a Custom Sparse Autoencoder."""\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        d_in: int,\n        d_sae: int,\n        hook_layer: int,\n        model_name: str = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped",\n        hook_name: Optional[str] = None,\n    ):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in, d_sae))\n        self.W_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae, d_in))\n        self.b_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_sae))\n        self.b_dec = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(d_in))\n        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")\n        self.dtype = torch.float32\n        \n        # Add properties to match the interface expected by CustomTrainer\n        self.activation_dim = d_in\n        self.dict_size = d_sae\n\n        # Add CustomSAEConfig integration\n        if hook_name is None:\n            hook_name = f"blocks.{hook_layer}.hook_resid_post"\n\n        self.cfg = CustomSAEConfig(\n            model_name=model_name,\n            d_in=d_in,\n            d_sae=d_sae,\n            hook_name=hook_name,\n            hook_layer=hook_layer,\n            architecture="Custom",\n            activation_fn_str="relu",\n            apply_b_dec_to_input=True,\n        )\n\n    def encode(self, input_acts):\n        pre_acts = (input_acts - self.b_dec) @ self.W_enc + self.b_enc\n        acts = torch.relu(pre_acts)\n        return acts\n\n    def decode(self, acts):\n        return (acts @ self.W_dec) + self.b_dec\n\n    def forward(self, acts, output_features=False):\n        encoded = self.encode(acts)\n        decoded = self.decode(encoded)\n        if output_features:\n            return decoded, encoded\n        return decoded\n\n    def to(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().to(*args, **kwargs)\n        device = kwargs.get("device", None)\n        dtype = kwargs.get("dtype", None)\n        if device:\n            self.device = device\n        if dtype:\n            self.dtype = dtype\n        return self\n\n\nclass ConstrainedAdam(torch.optim.Adam):\n    """A variant of Adam where some parameters are constrained to have unit norm."""\n    def __init__(self, params, constrained_params, lr):\n        super().__init__(params, lr=lr)\n        self.constrained_params = list(constrained_params)\n    \n    def step(self, closure=None):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                normed_p = p / p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n                p.grad -= (p.grad * normed_p).sum(dim=0, keepdim=True) * normed_p\n        super().step(closure=closure)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            for p in self.constrained_params:\n                p /= p.norm(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n\nclass SAETrainer:\n    """Base class for implementing SAE training algorithms."""\n    def __init__(self, seed=None):\n        self.seed = seed\n        self.logging_parameters = []\n\n    def update(self, step, activations):\n        """Update step for training.

This directly combats polysemanticity by preventing multiple concepts from being encoded in overlapping feature directions. Unlike previous approaches that modified activation functions or sparsity mechanisms, this targets the fundamental geometric structure of the learned features. By adding an orthogonality regularization term to the decoder weights (W_dec), we incentivize the model to learn more axis-aligned, interpretable features.

The core problem, as highlighted in the paper \'Applying sparse autoencoders to unlearn knowledge in language models\', is polysemanticity, where individual latent features appear to represent multiple, semantically distinct concepts. This hinders our ability to understand what neural networks are truly learning.\n\nYour task is to propose novel and feasible variants of sparse autoencoders that result in more interpretable latents compared to the internal activations they are trained to reconstruct. Consider the insights from the following abstract of a key paper in this area:\n\n"One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks\' internals is polysemanticity, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is superposition, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task wang2022interpretability to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability."\n\nSpecifically, you should focus on the following benchmarks: scr, tpp.\n\nSpurious Correlation Removal (SCR): In the SHIFT method, a human evaluator debiases a classifier by ablating SAE latents. We automate SHIFT and use it to measure whether an SAE has found separate latents for distinct concepts – the concept of gender, and the concepts for someone\'s profession for example. Distinct features will enable a more precise removal of spurious correlations, thereby effectively debiasing the classifier. First, we filter datasets (Bias in Bios and Amazon Reviews) for two binary labels. For example, we select text samples of two professions (professor, nurse) and the gender labels (male, female) from the Bias in Bios dataset. We partition this dataset into a balanced set—containing all combinations of professor/nurse and male/female—and a biased set that only includes male+professor and female+nurse combinations. We then train a linear classifier C_b on the biased dataset. The linear classifier picks up on both signals, such as gender and profession. During the evaluation, we attempt to debias the classifier C_b by selecting SAE latents related to one class (eg. gender) to increase classification accuracy for the other class (eg. profession). We select set L containing the top n SAE latents according to their absolute probe attribution score with a probe trained specifically to predict the spurious signal (eg. gender). Karvonen et al. found that the scores obtained with feature selection through probe attribution had a strong correlation with scores obtained with feature selection using an LLM judge. Thus, we select features using probe attribution to avoid the cost and potential biases associated with an LLM judge. For each original and spurious-feature-informed set L of selected features, we remove the spurious signal by defining a modified classifier C_m = C_b L where all selected unrelated yet with high attribution latents are zero-ablated. The accuracy with which the modified classifier C_m predicts the desired class when evaluated on the balanced dataset indicates SAE quality. A higher accuracy suggests that the SAE was more effective in isolating and removing the spurious correlation of e.g. gender, allowing the classifier to focus on the intended task of e.g. profession classification. We consider a normalized evaluation score: S_{SHIFT} = (A_{abl} - A_{base}) / (A_{oracle} - A_{base}) where A_{abl} is the probe accuracy after ablation, A_{base} is the baseline accuracy (spurious probe before ablation), and A_{oracle} is the skyline accuracy (probe trained directly on the desired concept). This score represents the proportion of improvement achieved through ablation relative to the maximum possible improvement, allowing fair comparison across different classes and models.In Targeted Probe Perturbation, SHIFT requires datasets with correlated labels. We generalize SHIFT to all multiclass NLP datasets by introducing the targeted probe perturbation (TPP) metric. At a high level, we aim to find sets of SAE latents that disentangle the dataset classes. Inspired by SHIFT, we train probes on the model activations and measure the effect of ablating sets of latents on the probe accuracy. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only have an isolated causal effect on one class probe, while leaving other class probes unaffected. We consider a dataset mapping text to exactly one of m concepts c in C. For each class with index i = 1, ..., m we select the set L_i of the most relevant SAE latents as described in section [ref]. Note that we select the top signed importance scores, as we are only interested in latents that actively contribute to the targeted class. For each concept c_i, we partition the dataset into samples of the targeted concept and a random mix of all other labels. We define the model with probe corresponding to concept c_j with j = 1, ..., m as a linear classifier C_j which is able to classify concept c_j with accuracy A_j. Further, C_{i,j} denotes a classifier for c_j where latents L_i are ablated. Then, we iteratively evaluate the accuracy A_{i,j} of all linear classifiers C_{i,j} on the dataset partitioned for the corresponding class c_j. The targeted probe perturbation score: S_{TPP} = mean_{(i=j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) - mean_{(i≠j)} (A_{i,j} - A_j) represents the effectiveness of causally isolating a single probe. Ablating a disentangled set of latents should only show a significant accuracy decrease if i = j, namely if the latents selected for class i are ablated in the classifier of the same class i, and remain constant if i ≠ j.The following is an example good target benchmark and proposed solution: **benchmark: Feature absorption: Sparsity incentivizes an undesirable phenomenon called feature absorption. Imagine an SAE learned two distinct latents tracking the features "starts with S" and "short". Since "short" always starts with S, the SAE can increase sparsity by absorbing the "starts with S" feature into the "short" latent and then no longer needs to fire the "starts with S" latent when the token "short" is present, as it already includes the "starts with S" feature direction.\n\nIn general, feature absorption is incentivised any time there\'s a pair of concepts, A & B, where A implies B (i.e. if A activates then B will always also be active, but not necessarily the other way round). This will happen with categories/hierarchies, e.g. India => Asia, pig => mammal, red => color, etc. If the SAE learns a latent for A and a latent for B, then both will fire on inputs with A. But this is redundant–A implies B, so there\'s no need for the B latent to light up on A. And if the model learns a latent for A and a latent for "B except for A", then only one activates. This is sparser, but clearly less interpretable!\n\nFeature absorption often happens in an unpredictable manner, resulting in unusual gerrymandered features. For example, the "starts with S" feature may fire on 95% of tokens beginning with S, yet fail to fire on an arbitrary 5% as the "starts with S" feature has been absorbed for this 5% of tokens. This is an undesirable property that we would like to minimize.\n\nTo quantify feature absorption, we follow the example in Chanin et al. and use a first letter classification task. First, tokens consisting of only English letters and an optional leading space are split into a train and test set, and a supervised logistic regression probe is trained on the train set using residual stream activations from the model. This probe is used as ground truth for the feature direction in the model. Next, k-sparse probing is performed on SAE latents from the train set to find which latents are most relevant for the task. The k=1 sparse probing latent is considered as a main SAE latent for the first letter task. To account for feature splitting, as k is increased from k=n to k=n+1, if the F1 score for the k=n+1 sparse probe represents an increase of more than τ_{fs} than the F1 of the k=n probe, the k=n+1 feature is considered a feature split and is added to the set of main SAE latents performing the first letter task. We use τ_fs=0.03 in line with Chanin et al.\n\nAfter the main feature split latents for the first letter task are found, we look for test set examples where the main feature split latents fail to correctly classify the token, but the logistic regression probe is able to correctly classify the sample. We then look for a different SAE latent that fires on this sample that has a cosine similarity with the probe of at least τ_{ps}, and where the SAE latent accounts for at least τ_{pa} portion of the probe projection in the activation. We use τ_{ps}=0.025 and τ_{pa}=0.4 in line with Chanin et al.. Proposed_solution: Matryoshka SAE: Matryoshka representation learning aims to learn nested representations where lower-dimensional features are embedded within higher-dimensional ones, similar to Russian Matryoshka dolls. The key idea is to explicitly optimize for good representation at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nWe adapt this approach to the context of sparse autoencoders. This means we can nest multiple sizes of dictionaries within each other. The largest autoencoder uses all latents for reconstruction, another uses the first half, a third uses the first quarter, and so on.\n\nThe losses of these nested autoencoders are summed.

By encouraging feature consistency across multiple SAEs, MFR increases the likelihood that learned features correspond to actual input features. This improvement could lead to more reliable and meaningful interpretations of neural network activations, advancing our understanding of how these models process information.", "Interestingness": 7, "Feasibility": 8, "Novelty": 6}\n\n{"Name": "switch_sparse_autoencoder", "Title": "Switch Sparse Autoencoders", "Experiment": "1.

It consists of multiple expert SAEs and a trainable routing network. The router computes a probability distribution over experts and routes input activations to the expert with the highest probability. This approach reduces computational costs by avoiding dense matrix multiplications. The model is trained on residual stream activations of GPT-2 small, optimizing for reconstruction MSE. The architecture allows for scaling to a large number of features (up to 34 million in this study) while maintaining computational efficiency. The Switch SAE demonstrates improved performance in terms of reconstruction error vs. sparsity trade-off compared to other SAE variants.", "Research_Impact": "A key challenge in mechanistic interpretability is scaling sparse autoencoders to very high widths to identify all features represented in frontier models. This research directly addresses this challenge by introducing the Switch SAE architecture, which reduces the compute cost of training wide SAEs.
