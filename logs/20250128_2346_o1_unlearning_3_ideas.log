 reasoning_content is Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to come up with a refined version of the prototype Orthogonal SAE idea that improves interpretability in sparse autoencoders, particularly targeting the benchmarks like core and sparse_probing. The key challenge is polysemanticity, and the prototype uses adaptive orthogonality with controlled feature sharing.

Hmm, the prototype's adaptive orthogonality loss allows some feature sharing via the alpha parameter. But maybe the fixed alpha throughout training isn't optimal. What if the level of sharing needed varies during training? Like, early on you might want more sharing to capture basic features, then gradually reduce it to encourage separation. That could help in better disentangling features without sacrificing reconstruction.

So, the idea is to make alpha dynamic, scheduling it from an initial value to a target. For example, start with higher alpha (more sharing) to learn basic features, then decay it to lower alpha (less sharing) to enforce orthogonality. This phased approach could balance reconstruction and feature separation better than a static alpha.

Also, the prototype uses group-specific biases. But if groups are updated periodically based on feature correlations, maybe the biases should adapt too. However, adding group-specific biases might complicate the model. Maybe instead, just focus on the dynamic alpha and the grouping mechanism.

Implementation-wise, the main changes would be modifying the orthogonality loss to include a scheduled alpha. The CustomSAE class would need to track the current alpha value, perhaps using a scheduler similar to the learning rate warmup. The orthogonality loss term would then be ||W_enc^T W_enc - alpha(t) I||_F^2, where alpha(t) decreases over time.

In the training loop, alpha could start at a higher value (e.g., 0.5) and linearly decay to a lower target (e.g., 0.1) over the course of training. This way, early training encourages some feature co-activation to capture broader patterns, while later stages push for more orthogonality to reduce polysemanticity.

For the experiments, comparing different alpha schedules (like linear decay vs. step decay) would show which approach better balances sparsity and interpretability. Evaluating on core metrics like L0 sparsity and cross-entropy loss would indicate if the dynamic approach maintains reconstruction quality while improving feature separation.

Also, the feature grouping in the prototype is updated every n steps. To make this efficient, maybe compute correlations using a moving average or batch statistics without storing all activations. But since the code already has a buffer, perhaps during the resample steps, they can compute feature correlations and update groups.

The implementation plan would involve adding a scheduler for alpha in the trainer, modifying the loss calculation to use the current alpha, and adjusting the group updates. The CustomTrainer's loss function would include the dynamic orthogonality term with the scheduled alpha.

Testing this should involve runs with different alpha schedules and measuring metrics like explained variance, sparsity, and the feature density statistics. On the sparse_probing benchmark, improved monosemanticity should lead to better probing accuracy when ablating specific features.

Potential issues: If alpha decays too quickly, the model might not learn enough shared features early on, hurting reconstruction. Tuning the schedule parameters (start alpha, end alpha, decay rate) would be crucial. Also, ensuring that the orthogonality term doesn't dominate the loss early, which could prevent effective learning.

In terms of feasibility, adding a scheduler for alpha is straightforward. The orthogonality loss is already a Frobenius norm, so adjusting alpha over time doesn't add computational complexity. The group updates every n steps are manageable as they're already part of the resampling process in the existing code.

Novelty comes from the dynamic control of feature sharing, which isn't present in the prototype's static alpha. This approach could better adapt to the training phases, leading to more effective feature separation without sacrificing reconstruction, which directly targets the core and sparse_probing benchmarks by enhancing interpretability.

The expected research impact is high because better-controlled feature sharing should reduce polysemanticity, leading to higher scores on core metrics like explained variance and lower L0 sparsity. Sparse_probing would benefit from more distinct features, improving classification accuracy when specific latents are ablated.

 content is THOUGHT:
The key insight is that strictly enforcing orthogonality too early in training may prevent the SAE from learning useful feature hierarchies, while complete non-orthogonality enables problematic feature absorption. The prototype's fixed α parameter for controlled sharing lacks adaptivity to training phases. My solution introduces phased orthogonality constraints - starting with loose similarity allowances for feature co-development, then gradually enforcing stricter orthogonality. This mimics curriculum learning where simpler feature relationships are learned first before complex disentanglement. By making the sharing parameter α time-dependent (α(t)), we enable dynamic feature collaboration without permanent entanglement. This should better prevent absorption while maintaining reconstruction quality compared to static approaches.

 reasoning_content is Okay, let's look at the previous idea. The phased orthogonal SAE with curriculum learning for feature disentanglement. The overall score was 8.5. The feasibility was 8, which is good but maybe can be improved.

The main issue I see is the feasibility evaluation mentioned adding 2-3 helper classes and 200 lines of code. Maybe that's a bit too much for a junior PhD student to implement within a month. Also, the technical details included using SVD approximations for correlation tracking, which might be computationally expensive and add complexity.

To improve feasibility, perhaps simplify the correlation tracking. Instead of using SVD, maybe use a simpler method like tracking pairwise cosine similarities with a moving average. That would reduce computational overhead and code complexity. Also, the phased orthogonality loss with α(t) could be implemented with a simple linear scheduler, avoiding more complex decay schedules initially.

The novelty was 8, but maybe by focusing on a more straightforward implementation of the curriculum approach without advanced math, the novelty remains while improving feasibility. The core idea is still the phased orthogonality, just with simpler components.

Research impact was 9, targeting core and sparse_probing. Keeping that focus is good. Implementation plan can be adjusted to remove the SVD part and use simpler correlation tracking. This would make the code changes minimal, perhaps just modifying the loss function and adding a scheduler for α(t).

So, revising the Technical_Details to remove SVD and replace with cosine similarity tracking. Update the Implementation_Plan accordingly. This should increase feasibility without losing the core idea. Also, adjust the experiment steps to reflect simpler schedules and metrics.

The abstract should still convey the curriculum approach but without mentioning complex math. The overall score might increase if feasibility goes up.

The revised idea maintains the core curriculum learning approach while simplifying implementation through cosine similarity tracking instead of SVD-based correlation matrices. By replacing complex covariance updates with per-feature pairwise similarity checks using moving averages, we reduce computational overhead and code complexity. This makes the implementation more feasible while preserving the key innovation of phased orthogonality. The simplified α(t) scheduling (linear decay only) maintains the curriculum effect without introducing multiple schedule types. These changes better align with the prototype's constraints while keeping the novel temporal dynamics intact.
