        "Research_Impact": "A key challenge in selective unlearning is precisely identifying and removing dangerous knowledge that manifests as temporal patterns while preserving safe knowledge with similar local structure. Current approaches that treat each token independently often fail to capture these temporal dependencies, leading to incomplete knowledge removal or unintended side effects. This research addresses the challenge through efficient temporal correlation tracking and chain-based interventions, enabling more precise knowledge removal while maintaining computational efficiency.",

        "Interestingness": 9,
        "Feasibility_Evaluation": "Implementation greatly simplified through correlation tracking and circular buffers; sparse operations ensure efficiency; quantization reduces memory usage; complete implementation feasible within 2 weeks; runtime reduced to 12-min limit on H100 due to optimized design.",
