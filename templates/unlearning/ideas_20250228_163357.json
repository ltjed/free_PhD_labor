        "Technical_Details": "The paper proposes two novel sparse autoencoder (SAE) variants: Feature Choice (FC) and Mutual Choice (MC). These allow for variable numbers of active features per token, framing the token-feature matching as a resource allocation problem with a total sparsity upper bound. The FC approach allows each feature to select m tokens to process, where m = M/F (M is total matches, F is number of features). MC combines aspects of FC and token choice. A new aux_zipf_loss is introduced to encourage feature densities to follow a Zipf distribution, mitigating feature under-utilization. The paper also suggests a phased training approach, starting with MC and transitioning to FC.",
        "Research_Impact": "A key challenge in mechanistic interpretability is extracting meaningful, interpretable features from neural networks while maintaining computational efficiency.

        "Technical_Details": "BatchTopK is a novel training method for Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that replaces the sample-level TopK operation with a batch-level constraint. Instead of enforcing a fixed number of active latents per sample, BatchTopK selects the top activations across the entire batch. This allows for variable sparsity per sample, with some samples using more latents and others using fewer. The method introduces a batch dependency during training, which is addressed during inference by estimating a global threshold parameter. This threshold is calculated as the average of minimum positive activation values across multiple batches. The SAE is trained on language model activations (e.g., from the residual stream) using a large text corpus. The loss function combines L2 reconstruction error with an L0 sparsity penalty. Experiments were conducted on GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B models, using dictionary sizes of 3072, 6144, 12288, and 24576, with a bandwidth parameter of 0.001 and the Adam optimizer (learning rate 3e-4).",

BatchTopK SAEs address this challenge by providing a more flexible and efficient way to compress and represent model activations. By allowing variable sparsity per sample, BatchTopK can potentially capture more nuanced and diverse activation patterns compared to fixed-sparsity methods. This improvement in reconstruction quality, as demonstrated by lower normalized MSE and reduced cross-entropy degradation, could lead to more accurate and insightful interpretations of model behavior. Furthermore, the ability to adaptively allocate latents based on sample complexity aligns well with the varying information content in natural language, potentially revealing more about how language models process different types of inputs.",

Compare against baseline feature selection methods",
        "Technical_Details": "The Knowledge Contrast SAE (KC-SAE) introduces a training approach specifically designed to improve targeted knowledge unlearning. The training alternates between batches from two datasets: the forget dataset (WMDP-bio corpus) and the retain dataset (WikiText).\n\nFor each feature i, we maintain exponential moving averages of its activation statistics on both domains: mean activation (\u03bc_i^forget, \u03bc_i^retain) and activation frequency (f_i^forget, f_i^retain). The knowledge contrast loss is defined as:\n\nL_contrast = \u03a3_i (\u03bc_i^forget * \u03bc_i^retain * f_i^forget * f_i^retain)\n\nThis formulation directly penalizes features that are both strongly and frequently activated in both domains, encouraging knowledge-domain specialization. The total loss function is:\n\nL = L_recon + \u03bb * L_contrast\n\nwhere \u03bb is a contrast weight that starts at 0 and increases linearly to its target value (default: 0.05) over the first 30% of training steps. This gradual introduction allows the model to first learn good reconstructions before specializing features.\n\nAfter training, we compute a domain contrast score for each feature:\n\nC_i = (\u03bc_i^forget * f_i^forget - \u03bc_i^retain * f_i^retain) / (\u03bc_i^forget * f_i^forget + \u03bc_i^retain * f_i^retain + \u03b5)\n\nThis score ranges from -1 (retain-only) to +1 (forget-only). For unlearning, we select features with C_i above a threshold (e.g., 0.3) and with retain-set sparsity below the retain_threshold parameter. These features are then clamped to negative values during inference, directly targeting knowledge from the forget domain.",
        "Rationale": "The unlearning benchmark evaluates how effectively an SAE can selectively remove specific knowledge (dangerous biology) while preserving general capabilities. Standard SAEs have two key limitations for this task:\n\n1. They don't distinguish between different knowledge domains during training\n2. They rely on post-training heuristics to identify features for unlearning\n\nThe Knowledge Contrast SAE addresses these limitations by explicitly encouraging features to specialize in representing knowledge from either the forget or retain domain, but not both. This improves unlearning performance through several specific mechanisms:\n\n1. More precise feature identification: By encouraging domain specialization, KC-SAE creates features that more clearly correspond to specific knowledge domains. This makes it easier to identify which features encode dangerous knowledge that should be unlearned, directly improving the precision of the feature selection process in the unlearning benchmark.\n\n2. Better alignment with negative clamping: The unlearning benchmark uses negative clamping of feature activations as the unlearning mechanism. This works best when features cleanly represent specific knowledge. Domain-specialized features are ideal targets for this intervention, as clamping them is more likely to affect only the targeted knowledge domain.\n\n3. Improved sparsity-based selection: The current benchmark uses sparsity on the retain set as a key criterion for feature selection. KC-SAE naturally creates features with different sparsity patterns across domains, making this selection criterion more effective.\n\n4. Balanced reconstruction quality: By using an annealed contrast weight, KC-SAE maintains good overall reconstruction quality while encouraging domain specialization. This ensures the SAE still captures the underlying structure of the data effectively.\n\nThe sequential training approach is more compatible with the existing codebase than a mixed-batch approach, requiring fewer modifications while still achieving the desired domain contrast effect. The contrast loss directly targets the co-activation of features across domains, which is exactly what we want to minimize for effective unlearning.\n\nImportantly, by using both activation magnitude and frequency in the contrast metrics, we address potential issues with rare but strong activations that might otherwise be overlooked. This provides a more robust measure of feature relevance to each knowledge domain.",
        "Implementation_Plan": "1. Modify the `ActivationBuffer` class to support alternating between datasets:\n   - Add a parameter to specify which dataset to use (forget or retain)\n   - Implement a switching mechanism to alternate between datasets\n\n2.
