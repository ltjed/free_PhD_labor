        "Technical_Details": "The paper proposes two novel sparse autoencoder (SAE) variants: Feature Choice (FC) and Mutual Choice (MC). These allow for variable numbers of active features per token, framing the token-feature matching as a resource allocation problem with a total sparsity upper bound. The FC approach allows each feature to select m tokens to process, where m = M/F (M is total matches, F is number of features). MC combines aspects of FC and token choice. A new aux_zipf_loss is introduced to encourage feature densities to follow a Zipf distribution, mitigating feature under-utilization. The paper also suggests a phased training approach, starting with MC and transitioning to FC.",
        "Research_Impact": "A key challenge in mechanistic interpretability is extracting meaningful, interpretable features from neural networks while maintaining computational efficiency. This research addresses this by introducing adaptive computation in SAEs, allowing more features and computation for difficult-to-reconstruct tokens.

        "Technical_Details": "BatchTopK is a novel training method for Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that replaces the sample-level TopK operation with a batch-level constraint. Instead of enforcing a fixed number of active latents per sample, BatchTopK selects the top activations across the entire batch. This allows for variable sparsity per sample, with some samples using more latents and others using fewer. The method introduces a batch dependency during training, which is addressed during inference by estimating a global threshold parameter. This threshold is calculated as the average of minimum positive activation values across multiple batches. The SAE is trained on language model activations (e.g., from the residual stream) using a large text corpus. The loss function combines L2 reconstruction error with an L0 sparsity penalty. Experiments were conducted on GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B models, using dictionary sizes of 3072, 6144, 12288, and 24576, with a bandwidth parameter of 0.001 and the Adam optimizer (learning rate 3e-4).",
        "Research_Impact": "A significant challenge in mechanistic interpretability is developing methods to effectively analyze and interpret the internal representations of large language models. BatchTopK SAEs address this challenge by providing a more flexible and efficient way to compress and represent model activations. By allowing variable sparsity per sample, BatchTopK can potentially capture more nuanced and diverse activation patterns compared to fixed-sparsity methods. This improvement in reconstruction quality, as demonstrated by lower normalized MSE and reduced cross-entropy degradation, could lead to more accurate and insightful interpretations of model behavior. Furthermore, the ability to adaptively allocate latents based on sample complexity aligns well with the varying information content in natural language, potentially revealing more about how language models process different types of inputs.",

Evaluate unlearning performance using standard and intervention-guided selection\n6. Analyze feature characteristics and unlearning effectiveness",
        "Technical_Details": "Intervention-Guided Feature Selection (IGFS) enhances knowledge unlearning by improving feature selection through a targeted intervention approach. After training a standard TopK SAE, we measure each feature's importance by intervening on batches of features and observing the effect on model performance. For computational efficiency, we use a grouped intervention approach: features are randomly divided into G groups (typically 50-100), and all features in each group are clamped simultaneously. We compute an Intervention Effect Score (IES) for each group as: IES_g = (Acc_baseline - Acc_clamped_g) / Acc_baseline, where Acc is the model's accuracy on multiple-choice questions from the forget dataset (WMDP-bio). This process is repeated N times (typically 5-10) with different random groupings to obtain a stable estimate of each feature's effect. The final Intervention Effect Score for feature i is the average IES of all groups containing that feature, normalized by the group size. We then compute a Specificity Score (SS) for each feature: SS_i = 1 - (IES_i^retain / IES_i^forget), where IES_i^retain is the feature's effect on the retain dataset (MMLU subsets). Features are ranked by a composite score: CS_i = IES_i^forget * SS_i. For unlearning, we select the top features according to this composite score, filtering out any with retain set sparsity below the retain_threshold, and clamp them during inference following the standard procedure.",
        "Rationale": "The current unlearning approach selects features based solely on activation patterns (sparsity), which may not identify the most effective features for targeted knowledge removal. Intervention-Guided Feature Selection addresses this limitation by directly measuring how intervening on features affects model performance on the specific knowledge we want to unlearn. This approach offers several advantages: 1) It identifies features that, when clamped, actually impact the model's ability to access the unwanted knowledge, providing a more direct measure than activation patterns alone; 2) The Specificity Score ensures we prioritize features that primarily affect the forget dataset with minimal impact on the retain dataset, preserving general capabilities; 3) The grouped intervention approach makes the method computationally feasible even for large SAEs with thousands of features. By focusing on the selection process rather than modifying SAE training, we maintain all the benefits of standard SAEs while improving the precision of unlearning. The composite ranking balances both the magnitude of a feature's effect on unwanted knowledge and its specificity to that knowledge domain. This should lead to more effective unlearning because we're selecting features that demonstrably affect the model's ability to access the specific knowledge we want to remove, while minimizing side effects on other capabilities.",
