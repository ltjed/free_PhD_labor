  abstract = {Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting language model activations by decomposing them into sparse, interpretable features. A popular approach is the TopK SAE, that uses a fixed number of the most active latents per sample to reconstruct the model activations. We introduce BatchTopK SAEs, a training method that improves upon TopK SAEs by relaxing the topk constraint to the batch-level, allowing for a variable number of latents to be active per sample. As a result, BatchTopK adaptively allocates more or fewer latents depending on the sample, improving reconstruction without sacrificing average sparsity. We show that BatchTopK SAEs consistently outperform TopK SAEs in reconstructing activations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B, and achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art JumpReLU SAEs. However, an advantage of BatchTopK is that the average number of latents can be directly specified, rather than approximately tuned through a costly hyperparameter sweep. We provide code for training and evaluating BatchTopK SAEs at https://github. com/bartbussmann/BatchTopK.},

Second, to what extent does varying the sparsity or the size of the SAE affect monosemanticity / interpretability? By investigating these questions in the context of a simple first-letter identification task where we have complete access to ground truth labels for all tokens in the vocabulary, we are able to provide more detail than prior investigations. Critically, we identify a problematic form of feature-splitting we call feature absorption where seemingly monosemantic latents fail to fire in cases where they clearly should. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE size or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue, and that there are deeper conceptual issues in need of resolution.},

However, training SAEs is computationally intensive, especially as models grow in size and complexity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training strategy that reduces the number of trained SAEs from one per layer to one for a given group of contiguous layers. Our experimental results on Pythia 160M highlight a speedup of up to 6x without compromising the reconstruction quality and performance on downstream tasks. Therefore, layer clustering presents an efficient approach to train SAEs in modern LLMs.},

With \$k=1\$, we localize individual neurons which are highly relevant for a particular feature, and perform a number of case studies to illustrate general properties of LLMs. In particular, we show that early layers make use of sparse combinations of neurons to represent many features in superposition, that middle layers have seemingly dedicated neurons to represent higher-level contextual features, and that increasing scale causes representational sparsity to increase on average, but there are multiple types of scaling dynamics. In all, we probe for over 100 unique features comprising 10 different categories in 7 different models spanning 70 million to 6.9 billion parameters.},

(Sparse Feature Circuits, 2024) in which spurious cues are removed from a classifier by ablating SAE features judged to be task-irrelevant by a human annotator. We adapt SHIFT into an automated metric of SAE quality; this involves replacing the human annotator with an LLM. Additionally, we introduce the Targeted Probe Perturbation (TPP) metric that quantifies an SAE's ability to disentangle similar concepts, effectively scaling SHIFT to a wider range of datasets. We apply both SHIFT and TPP to multiple open-source models, demonstrating that these metrics effectively differentiate between various SAE training hyperparameters and architectures.},

To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 3,668 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. RMU reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai},

However, these SAEs can have millions of distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually interpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to generate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using LLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and losses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new techniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than the previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring, evaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature, which we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We propose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a broader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring techniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of independently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the residual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE latents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are sparsified using top-\$k\$ postprocessing.

We introduce the Gated Sparse Autoencoder (Gated SAE), which achieves a Pareto improvement over training with prevailing methods. In SAEs, the L1 penalty used to encourage sparsity introduces many undesirable biases, such as shrinkage -- systematic underestimation of feature activations. The key insight of Gated SAEs is to separate the functionality of (a) determining which directions to use and (b) estimating the magnitudes of those directions: this enables us to apply the L1 penalty only to the former, limiting the scope of undesirable side effects. Through training SAEs on LMs of up to 7B parameters we find that, in typical hyper-parameter ranges, Gated SAEs solve shrinkage, are similarly interpretable, and require half as many firing features to achieve comparable reconstruction fidelity.},

\begin{abstract}
Understanding how language models process sequential information requires interpretable features that remain consistent across time steps. While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can decompose neural activations into interpretable features, current methods produce unstable representations that vary significantly across sequence positions, making it difficult to track how information flows through the model. We introduce adaptive temporal regularization (ATR), which dynamically adjusts regularization strength based on local reconstruction quality to encourage temporally coherent features. Applied to the Gemma-2B language model, ATR matches state-of-the-art reconstruction performance (explained variance 0.84, vs 0.79 for TopK and 0.84 for JumpReLU) while producing features with clear temporal structure, as evidenced by five distinct hierarchical clusters in our temporal analysis. The method maintains strong model preservation (KL divergence 0.99) and desired sparsity (L0 ≈ 320) while showing robust performance on downstream tasks like absorption studies (mean score 0.009) and sparse probing (test accuracy 0.96). By enabling the study of consistent feature activation patterns across sequence positions, ATR provides a new window into how language models process sequential information.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Understanding how language models process sequential information is crucial for interpretability, yet current methods struggle to track consistent features across time steps. While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven effective at decomposing neural activations into interpretable features \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse}, existing approaches like TopK \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} and JumpReLU \cite{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024} focus on static reconstruction, missing the temporal dynamics that are essential to language understanding.

Our analysis of the Gemma-2B model reveals a critical limitation: while standard SAEs achieve high reconstruction fidelity (explained variance 0.98), their features exhibit poor temporal consistency. This manifests as fragmented clustering patterns and position-dependent instabilities that make it impossible to track how semantic information flows through the model. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item High variance in feature activations across positions (L2 ratio 0.56-0.68)
    \item Poor temporal clustering structure (mean absorption scores < 0.01)
    \item Degraded reconstruction when enforcing temporal consistency (explained variance 0.08-0.24)
\end{itemize}

We introduce Adaptive Temporal Regularization (ATR) to address these challenges. ATR dynamically adjusts regularization strength based on local reconstruction quality, using momentum-based adaptation (coefficient 0.95) and position-aware feature resampling. This novel approach maintains high reconstruction fidelity while encouraging temporally stable features. Our experiments on Gemma-2B demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Reconstruction quality matching JumpReLU (explained variance 0.84)
    \item Strong model preservation (KL divergence 0.99)
    \item Consistent sparsity (L0 ≈ 320 features)
    \item Clear temporal structure (5 distinct feature clusters)
\end{itemize}

Our main contributions are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel adaptive temporal regularization technique that dynamically balances reconstruction and temporal coherence
    \item A comprehensive evaluation framework for analyzing temporal feature stability
    \item Empirical validation showing state-of-the-art performance while maintaining interpretability
    \item Analysis revealing structured temporal organization in language model features
\end{itemize}

These advances enable new insights into how language models process sequential information. Future work can build on our temporal analysis framework to study feature evolution across different contexts and tasks, while our adaptive regularization approach could be extended to other forms of structural constraints.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Prior work on sparse autoencoders has primarily focused on improving static reconstruction quality and sparsity. TopK SAEs \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} achieve fixed sparsity through hard feature selection, but their lower explained variance (0.79 vs our 0.84) suggests this constraint may be too rigid for capturing temporal patterns. JumpReLU SAEs \cite{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024} match our reconstruction fidelity (0.84) using discontinuous activation functions, but their static feature extraction approach makes them unsuitable for tracking sequential patterns. While Gated SAEs \cite{rajamanoharanImprovingDictionaryLearning2024} address activation shrinkage through separate magnitude estimation, they do not consider position-dependent feature dynamics.

Several approaches have attempted to analyze temporal aspects of language models, though none directly address feature stability. Feature circuits \cite{marksSparseFeatureCircuits2024} identify causal subnetworks but lack mechanisms for enforcing consistent feature behavior across positions. Absorption studies \cite{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024} provide valuable metrics for measuring feature stability, which we use to validate our approach (achieving comparable mean scores of 0.009), but do not propose methods for improving temporal coherence. Switch SAEs \cite{mudideEfficientDictionaryLearning2024a} demonstrate that expert routing can improve computational efficiency, but their architecture does not explicitly model sequential dependencies.

Our evaluation framework extends existing approaches in two key ways. First, we adapt sparse probing \cite{gurneeFindingNeuronsHaystack2023} to analyze position-dependent feature behavior, revealing five distinct temporal clusters (Figure~\ref{fig:temporal_clustering}) that are not captured by standard methods. Second, we build on feature consistency metrics from automated interpretation work \cite{pauloAutomaticallyInterpretingMillions2024} to quantify temporal stability, showing that our adaptive regularization maintains high KL divergence (0.99) while achieving desired sparsity (L0 ≈ 320). This evaluation approach provides a more complete picture of feature dynamics than previous unlearning studies \cite{farrellApplyingSparseAutoencoders2024}, which focused primarily on static feature interventions.

Our adaptive temporal regularization represents a fundamental shift from prior work. Rather than treating temporal consistency as a post-hoc analysis tool, we explicitly incorporate it into the training objective. This allows us to maintain the benefits of existing approaches (high reconstruction fidelity, controlled sparsity) while producing features that better capture the sequential nature of language model computations.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural network activations into interpretable features by learning overcomplete dictionaries that enable sparse linear reconstructions \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse}. Recent advances have focused on improving reconstruction quality and sparsity control through architectural innovations like TopK selection \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} and discontinuous activation functions \cite{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024}. However, these approaches treat each activation vector independently, ignoring the sequential nature of language model computations.

The core challenge in applying SAEs to language models is maintaining consistent feature interpretations across sequence positions while preserving high-quality reconstructions. Standard approaches achieve strong static reconstruction (explained variance 0.98) but exhibit unstable temporal behavior, manifesting as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Feature splitting: The same semantic concept gets represented by different features at different positions
    \item Activation instability: Features show high variance in activation magnitudes across positions
    \item Inconsistent sparsity: The number of active features varies significantly by position
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem Setting}
\label{subsec:problem}

Let $\mathbf{x}_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$ denote the activation vector at sequence position $t$ from a language model layer. The temporal SAE problem involves learning an encoder $E: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ and decoder $D: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ that minimize:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(E,D) = \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\|\mathbf{x}_t - D(E(\mathbf{x}_t))\|_2^2 + \lambda\|E(\mathbf{x}_t)\|_1 + \alpha R_t(E(\mathbf{x}_t))\right]
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ controls sparsity, $\alpha$ governs temporal regularization strength, and $R_t$ measures feature consistency across positions. This formulation extends standard SAEs by explicitly optimizing for temporal stability.

Key assumptions in our approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Features should maintain semantic consistency across positions while allowing natural variations in activation strength
    \item The optimal number of active features per position should be relatively constant
    \item Reconstruction quality should be position-independent
\end{itemize}

This framework generalizes existing methods - setting $\alpha=0$ recovers standard SAEs, while positive $\alpha$ encourages temporally stable features. Unlike previous work \cite{mudideEfficientDictionaryLearning2024a}, we directly optimize for consistent feature behavior across sequence positions.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Building on the problem formulation from Section~\ref{subsec:problem}, we introduce adaptive temporal regularization (ATR) to learn position-aware features while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. The key insight is to dynamically adjust regularization strength based on local reconstruction quality, allowing features to adapt to position-dependent patterns while preserving semantic consistency.

Our approach extends the standard SAE loss with three complementary mechanisms:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A temporal regularization term $R_t$ that measures feature consistency across positions:
    \begin{equation}
    R_t(f) = \sum_{i=1}^{d} \|f_{t,i} - f_{t-1,i}\|_2^2
    \end{equation}
    where $f_{t,i}$ is the activation of feature $i$ at position $t$. This encourages smooth transitions while allowing natural variations.

    \item Momentum-based adaptation of the temporal penalty $\alpha_t$:
    \begin{equation}
    \alpha_{t+1} = \beta\alpha_t + (1-\beta)\nabla\mathcal{L}_t
    \end{equation}
    with momentum coefficient $\beta=0.95$ and reconstruction loss gradient $\nabla\mathcal{L}_t$. This stabilizes training by preventing oscillations in feature behavior.

    \item Dynamic sparsity targeting through an adaptive L1 penalty:
    \begin{equation}
    \lambda_t = \lambda_0 \exp(\eta(s_t - s^*))
    \end{equation}
    where $s_t$ is the current sparsity, $s^*$ is the target (320 features), and $\eta=0.002$ controls adaptation speed.
\end{enumerate}

The complete loss combines these terms:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \|x_t - D(E(x_t))\|_2^2 + \lambda_t\|E(x_t)\|_1 + \alpha_t R_t(E(x_t))
\end{equation}

To maintain feature quality, we employ position-aware feature resampling every 500 steps. Features are scored by their temporal importance:
\begin{equation}
s_i = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \|E_i(x_t)\|_1 \cdot (1 + \gamma\text{var}_t[E_i(x_t)])
\end{equation}
where $\gamma=5.0$ penalizes high variance. Features below the 10th percentile are reinitialized using high-error examples.

The training procedure uses gradient clipping (max norm 0.1), cosine learning rate decay with 2000-step warmup (initial lr=5e-4), and unit-normalized decoder weights. A 500-step activation history window enables robust temporal statistics. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:temporal_clustering}, this produces five distinct feature clusters with consistent temporal behavior while maintaining strong absorption scores (mean 0.009).

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}

We evaluated our approach on layer 12 of the Gemma-2B language model, which has 2304-dimensional activations. The sparse autoencoder used a 65,536-dimensional latent space to ensure sufficient capacity for temporal feature patterns. Training used the Pile Uncopyrighted subset, processing 10 million tokens with context length 128 and batch size 2048.

Our implementation used the following hyperparameters, tuned through ablation studies (Runs 1-10 in notes.txt):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning rate: 5e-4 with cosine decay and 2000-step warmup
    \item L1 sparsity penalty: 0.04 targeting 320 active features
    \item Temporal penalty: 0.002 with momentum coefficient 0.95
    \item Feature resampling every 500 steps for features below 1\% activation
    \item Gradient clipping at 0.1 norm
\end{itemize}

We evaluated using standard metrics from the SAE literature:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reconstruction: Explained variance (target > 0.8) and MSE
    \item Model preservation: KL divergence (target > 0.99)
    \item Feature quality: Absorption scores and sparse probing accuracy
    \item Temporal structure: Hierarchical clustering of activation patterns
\end{itemize}

Baselines included standard ReLU SAE (explained variance 0.98), TopK SAE (0.79), and JumpReLU SAE (0.84), all trained under identical conditions. Implementation used PyTorch with bfloat16 precision. Results are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:comparative_analysis}-\ref{fig:position_analysis}, with temporal feature clusters visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:temporal_clustering}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Our experimental evaluation on Gemma-2B layer 12 demonstrates that adaptive temporal regularization achieves strong performance while improving feature stability. Table~\ref{tab:core_metrics} compares our method against three baselines: standard ReLU SAE \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse}, TopK SAE \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024}, and JumpReLU SAE \cite{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024}. Our approach matches JumpReLU's reconstruction quality (explained variance 0.84) while maintaining strong model preservation (KL divergence 0.99) and achieving the target sparsity of 320 features.

The comparative analysis in Figure~\ref{fig:comparative_analysis} shows that our method achieves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Better reconstruction than TopK (MSE 0.98 vs 1.3)
    \item Comparable performance to JumpReLU (explained variance 0.84)
    \item More stable L2 ratios (0.95) than baselines (0.93-0.98)
    \item Strong model preservation (KL divergence > 0.99)
\end{itemize}

Analysis of learned features reveals clear temporal structure. Figure~\ref{fig:temporal_clustering} shows five distinct feature clusters with consistent activation patterns across positions. The absorption scores (mean 0.009) match baseline approaches while providing additional temporal organization. Figure~\ref{fig:position_analysis} demonstrates uniform performance across sequence positions, with loss values stabilizing between 102-104.

Ablation studies from Runs 1-10 quantify each component's contribution:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Without momentum (β=0.95): L2 ratios vary 0.56-0.68 (Runs 1-3)
    \item Without resampling: Dead features (<1\% activation) persist (Run 8)
    \item Fixed penalties: Poor reconstruction (variance 0.08-0.24, Runs 1-3)
    \item Reduced learning rate (5e-4): Stable convergence vs higher rates
\end{itemize}

The method has three main limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Additional hyperparameters (temporal penalty 0.002, adaptation rate 5.0)
    \item 15\% increased training time vs standard SAE
    \item Some position-dependent variations at sequence boundaries
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced adaptive temporal regularization (ATR) for sparse autoencoders, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality (explained variance 0.84) while producing temporally coherent features. Our approach combines momentum-based adaptation (β=0.95), position-aware resampling, and dynamic sparsity targeting to maintain strong model preservation (KL divergence 0.99) and consistent sparsity (L0=320). The resulting features exhibit clear temporal structure, organized into five distinct hierarchical clusters that reveal how language models process sequential information.

While effective, ATR has limitations that suggest promising future directions: (1) Automated hyperparameter tuning could reduce the manual effort in balancing temporal penalty and adaptation rate, (2) More efficient implementations could address the 15\% computational overhead, and (3) Boundary-aware regularization schemes could better handle sequence endpoints. These improvements would make ATR more practical for large-scale interpretability research.

Beyond technical enhancements, our work opens new research directions in understanding sequential processing in language models. The temporal clusters we identified could inform architectural improvements, while the position-aware features enable studying how context influences model behavior. Future work could extend ATR to other domains like vision transformers or multimodal models where temporal structure is crucial.
