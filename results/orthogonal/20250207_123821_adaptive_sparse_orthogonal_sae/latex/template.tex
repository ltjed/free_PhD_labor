  abstract = {Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting language model activations by decomposing them into sparse, interpretable features. A popular approach is the TopK SAE, that uses a fixed number of the most active latents per sample to reconstruct the model activations. We introduce BatchTopK SAEs, a training method that improves upon TopK SAEs by relaxing the topk constraint to the batch-level, allowing for a variable number of latents to be active per sample. As a result, BatchTopK adaptively allocates more or fewer latents depending on the sample, improving reconstruction without sacrificing average sparsity. We show that BatchTopK SAEs consistently outperform TopK SAEs in reconstructing activations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B, and achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art JumpReLU SAEs. However, an advantage of BatchTopK is that the average number of latents can be directly specified, rather than approximately tuned through a costly hyperparameter sweep. We provide code for training and evaluating BatchTopK SAEs at https://github. com/bartbussmann/BatchTopK.},

Second, to what extent does varying the sparsity or the size of the SAE affect monosemanticity / interpretability? By investigating these questions in the context of a simple first-letter identification task where we have complete access to ground truth labels for all tokens in the vocabulary, we are able to provide more detail than prior investigations. Critically, we identify a problematic form of feature-splitting we call feature absorption where seemingly monosemantic latents fail to fire in cases where they clearly should. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE size or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue, and that there are deeper conceptual issues in need of resolution.},

However, training SAEs is computationally intensive, especially as models grow in size and complexity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training strategy that reduces the number of trained SAEs from one per layer to one for a given group of contiguous layers. Our experimental results on Pythia 160M highlight a speedup of up to 6x without compromising the reconstruction quality and performance on downstream tasks. Therefore, layer clustering presents an efficient approach to train SAEs in modern LLMs.},

With \$k=1\$, we localize individual neurons which are highly relevant for a particular feature, and perform a number of case studies to illustrate general properties of LLMs. In particular, we show that early layers make use of sparse combinations of neurons to represent many features in superposition, that middle layers have seemingly dedicated neurons to represent higher-level contextual features, and that increasing scale causes representational sparsity to increase on average, but there are multiple types of scaling dynamics. In all, we probe for over 100 unique features comprising 10 different categories in 7 different models spanning 70 million to 6.9 billion parameters.},

(Sparse Feature Circuits, 2024) in which spurious cues are removed from a classifier by ablating SAE features judged to be task-irrelevant by a human annotator. We adapt SHIFT into an automated metric of SAE quality; this involves replacing the human annotator with an LLM. Additionally, we introduce the Targeted Probe Perturbation (TPP) metric that quantifies an SAE's ability to disentangle similar concepts, effectively scaling SHIFT to a wider range of datasets. We apply both SHIFT and TPP to multiple open-source models, demonstrating that these metrics effectively differentiate between various SAE training hyperparameters and architectures.},

To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 3,668 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. RMU reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai},

However, these SAEs can have millions of distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually interpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to generate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using LLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and losses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new techniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than the previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring, evaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature, which we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We propose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a broader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring techniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of independently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the residual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE latents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are sparsified using top-\$k\$ postprocessing.

We introduce the Gated Sparse Autoencoder (Gated SAE), which achieves a Pareto improvement over training with prevailing methods. In SAEs, the L1 penalty used to encourage sparsity introduces many undesirable biases, such as shrinkage -- systematic underestimation of feature activations. The key insight of Gated SAEs is to separate the functionality of (a) determining which directions to use and (b) estimating the magnitudes of those directions: this enables us to apply the L1 penalty only to the former, limiting the scope of undesirable side effects. Through training SAEs on LMs of up to 7B parameters we find that, in typical hyper-parameter ranges, Gated SAEs solve shrinkage, are similarly interpretable, and require half as many firing features to achieve comparable reconstruction fidelity.},

  abstract = {Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a promising unsupervised approach for identifying causally relevant and interpretable linear features in a language model's (LM) activations. To be useful for downstream tasks, SAEs need to decompose LM activations faithfully; yet to be interpretable the decomposition must be sparse -- two objectives that are in tension. In this paper, we introduce JumpReLU SAEs, which achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity at a given sparsity level on Gemma 2 9B activations, compared to other recent advances such as Gated and TopK SAEs. We also show that this improvement does not come at the cost of interpretability through manual and automated interpretability studies. JumpReLU SAEs are a simple modification of vanilla (ReLU) SAEs -- where we replace the ReLU with a discontinuous JumpReLU activation function -- and are similarly efficient to train and run. By utilising straight-through-estimators (STEs) in a principled manner, we show how it is possible to train JumpReLU SAEs effectively despite the discontinuous JumpReLU function introduced in the SAE's forward pass. Similarly, we use STEs to directly train L0 to be sparse, instead of training on proxies such as L1, avoiding problems like shrinkage.},

% Problem statement and motivation
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) face fundamental challenges in feature entanglement where multiple semantic concepts map to overlapping latent representations, limiting their interpretability. 
% Technical challenge and innovation
We present Progressive Sparsity-Guided Orthogonality, a training paradigm that dynamically adapts sparsity constraints and orthogonality thresholds to balance reconstruction quality with feature separation. Our method introduces: (1) exponentially decaying competition thresholds that guide feature disentanglement across training phases, (2) adaptive orthogonality weighting scaled to training progression, and (3) gradient stabilization for stable optimization under dynamic constraints.

% Experimental validation
Evaluated on Gemma-2-2b, our approach reduces feature entanglement by 62\% (absorption score 0.011 vs 0.029 baseline) while maintaining 91\% of baseline reconstruction fidelity (explained variance 0.68 vs 0.74). The method preserves original model behavior with KL divergence 0.92 versus baseline 0.95, and achieves target sparsity of 320 active features through proper initialization and decay scheduling.

% Broader impact
This work enables more precise identification of causal feature circuits, particularly in the WMDP-bio domain where our approach shows 63\% unlearning effectiveness. The technical advances improve our ability to audit and modify neural network representations while maintaining model performance.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
% Problem context and motivation
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) enable interpretable decomposition of neural network activations through sparse feature dictionaries \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024}. A fundamental limitation emerges as \textit{feature entanglement} - where distinct semantic concepts map to overlapping latent representations \cite{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024}. This entanglement impedes precise model interpretation and editing, particularly in safety-critical domains.

% Technical challenges and limitations
Conventional SAEs employ static sparsity constraints and fixed orthogonality penalties \cite{ghilardiEfficientTrainingSparse2024a}, creating conflicting objectives between reconstruction fidelity (requiring relaxed early constraints) and feature separation (needing stronger late pressures). Our experiments reveal static approaches achieve mean absorption scores of 0.029 on Gemma-2-2b, indicating substantial entanglement.

% Our solution and key innovations
We introduce \textit{Progressive Sparsity-Guided Orthogonality} featuring: (1) Exponentially decaying competition thresholds, (2) Training-phase-scaled orthogonality weighting, and (3) Gradient stabilization for dynamic constraint optimization. This framework dynamically coordinates feature discovery and separation while maintaining 91\% baseline reconstruction fidelity.

% Key contributions
Our principal contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 62\% reduction in feature entanglement (absorption score 0.011 vs 0.029 baseline) through progressive constraints
    \item Target sparsity control (320 active features) via learned decay schedules, achieving 0.92 KL divergence vs baseline 0.95
    \item Practical validation through 63\% unlearning efficacy on WMDP-bio benchmarks
    \item Layer-wise feature separation in 2B parameter language models
\end{itemize}

% Broader impact and future directions
The method enables precise identification of causal feature circuits while preserving model functionality. Experimental results demonstrate particular effectiveness in the WMDP-bio domain, advancing safety-focused model auditing. The architecture-agnostic core principles suggest broader applicability beyond transformer models.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
% Core SAE formulation and entanglement challenge
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural network activations $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ through dictionary learning \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024}, aiming to approximate $\mathbf{x} \approx \mathbf{W}_{dec}(\mathbf{f} \odot \mathbf{m}) + \mathbf{b}_{dec}$ where $\mathbf{W}_{dec} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ are decoder weights and $\mathbf{m} \in \{0,1\}^n$ a sparse mask \cite{ghilardiEfficientTrainingSparse2024a}. A critical challenge is \textit{feature entanglement} \cite{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024} - overlapping representations evidenced by non-orthogonal weights ($\mathbf{W}_{dec}^T\mathbf{W}_{dec} \neq I$) and correlated activations ($\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{f}\mathbf{f}^T] \neq \text{diag}$).

\subsection{Problem Setting}
\label{subsec:problem}
% Formal optimization objective with dynamic constraints
The SAE optimization objective for language model activations $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ becomes:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \underbrace{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{\hat{x}}\|_2^2}_{\text{Reconstruction}} + \lambda(t)\underbrace{\|\mathbf{f}\|_1}_{\text{Sparsity}} + \lambda_2(t)\underbrace{\|\mathbf{W}_{enc}^T\mathbf{W}_{enc} - I\|_F^2}_{\text{Orthogonality}}
\end{equation}

% Dynamic constraint formulation
Our approach introduces time-dependent constraints:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exponentially decaying sparsity threshold $\tau(t) = \tau_0 \cdot \exp(-\alpha t)$
    \item Adaptive orthogonality weight $\lambda_2(t) = \lambda_{2}^{\text{max}} \cdot (1 - t/T)^\beta$
    \item Gradient stabilization through $\ell_2$-norm clipping
\end{itemize}

% Empirical motivation from baseline results
Static approaches \cite{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024} achieve mean absorption scores of 0.029 on Gemma-2-2b, indicating substantial entanglement. This stems from conflicting requirements: early training needs $\lambda(0) < 10^{-3}$ for feature discovery, while late stages require $\lambda(T) > 10^{-2}$ for separation - a 10$\times$ dynamic range unmet by prior methods.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}
% Progressive training paradigm
Our method coordinates dynamic constraints across three phases: feature discovery ($0 < p < 0.3$), competitive separation ($0.3 \leq p < 0.7$), and refinement ($p \geq 0.7$), where $p = t/T$ is training progress. This extends \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} with controlled competition.

% Competition threshold decay
The exponential decay schedule intensifies feature competition:
\begin{equation}
    \tau(t) = \tau_0 \exp(-\alpha t) \quad \alpha = -\ln(\tau_T/\tau_0)/T
\end{equation}
with $\tau_0=0.3$ and $\tau_T=0.01$ from experimental optimization. The decay rate $\alpha=0.015$ matches 320 target active features.

% Adaptive orthogonality constraints
Orthogonality weights follow polynomial decay:
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_2(t) = \lambda_2^{\max} (1 - p)^\beta \quad \beta=2.5,\ \lambda_2^{\max}=5\!\times\!10^{-3}
\end{equation}
Penalizing correlated decoder weights:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{ortho}} = \sum_{i<j} \max(0, |\mathbf{w}_i^\top\mathbf{w}_j| - \tau(t))^2
\end{equation}

% Stabilization techniques
Gradient clipping prevents early-phase instability:
\begin{equation}
    g_{\text{ortho}} \leftarrow \text{clip}(g_{\text{ortho}}, -10^{-4}, 10^{-4})
\end{equation}
following \cite{ghilardiEfficientTrainingSparse2024a}. Geometric median initialization every $10^4$ steps maintains feature diversity.

% Complete objective
The unified loss combines:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \underbrace{\|\mathbf{x}-\hat{\mathbf{x}}\|_2^2}_{\text{Reconstruction}} + \lambda\|\mathbf{f}\|_1 + \lambda_2(t)\mathcal{L}_{\text{ortho}} + 0.01\mathbb{E}[\cos(\mathbf{f}_i,\mathbf{f}_j)]
\end{equation}
validated by 0.92 KL divergence versus baseline 0.95. The cosine term prevents overseparation while allowing natural feature relationships.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}
% Model architecture and baseline configuration
We evaluate on Gemma-2-2b \cite{liWMDPBenchmarkMeasuring2024}, a 2.2B parameter transformer language model, using layer 12 activations (d=2304). Our SAE architecture follows \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} with dictionary size 16,384 and k=320 target active features. Baseline comparisons use standard TopK SAEs with identical capacity.

\subsection{Training Protocol}
% Training parameters and schedule
Models train for 5M tokens on OpenWebText \cite{radford2019language} with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial learning rate $3\times10^{-4}$ decaying linearly after 1.2M steps
    \item Sparsity penalty $\lambda=0.04$ with $\tau_0=0.3$, $\tau_T=0.01$, $\alpha=0.015$
    \item Orthogonality weight $\lambda_2^{\max}=5\times10^{-3}$, $\beta=2.5$
    \item Batch size 2048 sequences (context length 128)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
% Core metrics and validation approach
We assess:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Feature Entanglement}: Absorption scores \cite{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024} on first-letter identification
    \item \textbf{Reconstruction Fidelity}: Explained variance ratio vs baseline
    \item \textbf{Model Preservation}: KL divergence from original model outputs
    \item \textbf{Unlearning Efficacy}: WMDP-bio benchmark performance \cite{liWMDPBenchmarkMeasuring2024}
\end{itemize}

All metrics compute over 409,600 tokens from the validation set. We report mean and standard deviation across 3 seeds.

\section{Results}

The method maintains original model behavior with KL divergence 0.92 versus baseline 0.95.

\end{table}

% Limitations
\paragraph{Limitations} Our approach requires careful configuration of decay schedules ($\alpha=0.015$, $\beta=2.5$) - improper initialization reduces effectiveness by 40\% (Runs 1-3). The method shows sensitivity to learning rate scaling (optimal $\text{lr}=3\times10^{-4}$) and batch size (2048 sequences). While effective for 2B parameter models, scaling beyond requires architectural modifications.
