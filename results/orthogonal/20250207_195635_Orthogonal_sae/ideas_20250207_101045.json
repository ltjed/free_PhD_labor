        "Technical_Details": "The paper proposes two novel sparse autoencoder (SAE) variants: Feature Choice (FC) and Mutual Choice (MC). These allow for variable numbers of active features per token, framing the token-feature matching as a resource allocation problem with a total sparsity upper bound. The FC approach allows each feature to select m tokens to process, where m = M/F (M is total matches, F is number of features). MC combines aspects of FC and token choice. A new aux_zipf_loss is introduced to encourage feature densities to follow a Zipf distribution, mitigating feature under-utilization. The paper also suggests a phased training approach, starting with MC and transitioning to FC.",

        "Technical_Details": "BatchTopK is a novel training method for Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that replaces the sample-level TopK operation with a batch-level constraint. Instead of enforcing a fixed number of active latents per sample, BatchTopK selects the top activations across the entire batch. This allows for variable sparsity per sample, with some samples using more latents and others using fewer. The method introduces a batch dependency during training, which is addressed during inference by estimating a global threshold parameter. This threshold is calculated as the average of minimum positive activation values across multiple batches. The SAE is trained on language model activations (e.g., from the residual stream) using a large text corpus. The loss function combines L2 reconstruction error with an L0 sparsity penalty. Experiments were conducted on GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B models, using dictionary sizes of 3072, 6144, 12288, and 24576, with a bandwidth parameter of 0.001 and the Adam optimizer (learning rate 3e-4).",

BatchTopK SAEs address this challenge by providing a more flexible and efficient way to compress and represent model activations. By allowing variable sparsity per sample, BatchTopK can potentially capture more nuanced and diverse activation patterns compared to fixed-sparsity methods. This improvement in reconstruction quality, as demonstrated by lower normalized MSE and reduced cross-entropy degradation, could lead to more accurate and insightful interpretations of model behavior.
