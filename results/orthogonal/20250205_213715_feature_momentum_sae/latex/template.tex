  abstract = {Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting language model activations by decomposing them into sparse, interpretable features. A popular approach is the TopK SAE, that uses a fixed number of the most active latents per sample to reconstruct the model activations. We introduce BatchTopK SAEs, a training method that improves upon TopK SAEs by relaxing the topk constraint to the batch-level, allowing for a variable number of latents to be active per sample. As a result, BatchTopK adaptively allocates more or fewer latents depending on the sample, improving reconstruction without sacrificing average sparsity. We show that BatchTopK SAEs consistently outperform TopK SAEs in reconstructing activations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B, and achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art JumpReLU SAEs. However, an advantage of BatchTopK is that the average number of latents can be directly specified, rather than approximately tuned through a costly hyperparameter sweep. We provide code for training and evaluating BatchTopK SAEs at https://github. com/bartbussmann/BatchTopK.},

Second, to what extent does varying the sparsity or the size of the SAE affect monosemanticity / interpretability? By investigating these questions in the context of a simple first-letter identification task where we have complete access to ground truth labels for all tokens in the vocabulary, we are able to provide more detail than prior investigations. Critically, we identify a problematic form of feature-splitting we call feature absorption where seemingly monosemantic latents fail to fire in cases where they clearly should. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE size or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue, and that there are deeper conceptual issues in need of resolution.},

However, training SAEs is computationally intensive, especially as models grow in size and complexity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training strategy that reduces the number of trained SAEs from one per layer to one for a given group of contiguous layers. Our experimental results on Pythia 160M highlight a speedup of up to 6x without compromising the reconstruction quality and performance on downstream tasks. Therefore, layer clustering presents an efficient approach to train SAEs in modern LLMs.},

With \$k=1\$, we localize individual neurons which are highly relevant for a particular feature, and perform a number of case studies to illustrate general properties of LLMs. In particular, we show that early layers make use of sparse combinations of neurons to represent many features in superposition, that middle layers have seemingly dedicated neurons to represent higher-level contextual features, and that increasing scale causes representational sparsity to increase on average, but there are multiple types of scaling dynamics. In all, we probe for over 100 unique features comprising 10 different categories in 7 different models spanning 70 million to 6.9 billion parameters.},

(Sparse Feature Circuits, 2024) in which spurious cues are removed from a classifier by ablating SAE features judged to be task-irrelevant by a human annotator. We adapt SHIFT into an automated metric of SAE quality; this involves replacing the human annotator with an LLM. Additionally, we introduce the Targeted Probe Perturbation (TPP) metric that quantifies an SAE's ability to disentangle similar concepts, effectively scaling SHIFT to a wider range of datasets. We apply both SHIFT and TPP to multiple open-source models, demonstrating that these metrics effectively differentiate between various SAE training hyperparameters and architectures.},

To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 3,668 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. RMU reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai},

However, these SAEs can have millions of distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually interpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to generate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using LLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and losses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new techniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than the previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring, evaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature, which we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We propose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a broader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring techniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of independently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the residual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE latents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are sparsified using top-\$k\$ postprocessing.

We introduce the Gated Sparse Autoencoder (Gated SAE), which achieves a Pareto improvement over training with prevailing methods. In SAEs, the L1 penalty used to encourage sparsity introduces many undesirable biases, such as shrinkage -- systematic underestimation of feature activations. The key insight of Gated SAEs is to separate the functionality of (a) determining which directions to use and (b) estimating the magnitudes of those directions: this enables us to apply the L1 penalty only to the former, limiting the scope of undesirable side effects. Through training SAEs on LMs of up to 7B parameters we find that, in typical hyper-parameter ranges, Gated SAEs solve shrinkage, are similarly interpretable, and require half as many firing features to achieve comparable reconstruction fidelity.},

By utilising straight-through-estimators (STEs) in a principled manner, we show how it is possible to train JumpReLU SAEs effectively despite the discontinuous JumpReLU function introduced in the SAE's forward pass. Similarly, we use STEs to directly train L0 to be sparse, instead of training on proxies such as L1, avoiding problems like shrinkage.},

\begin{abstract}
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting large language models by decomposing neural activations into interpretable features. However, these features often exhibit problematic behaviors such as feature absorption, where semantically distinct concepts become entangled. While existing approaches can improve feature separation, they typically do so at the cost of reconstruction quality. We introduce per-feature momentum tracking, which monitors and penalizes feature competition using exponential moving averages of feature correlations, allowing the model to identify and discourage persistent entanglement while being robust to temporary correlations. Through extensive experimentation on the Gemma-2-2B language model, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly better feature separation (absorption score of 0.0046 vs baseline 0.0161) while maintaining strong sparse probing performance (0.914 accuracy). Our final configuration balances momentum rate (0.95), competition threshold (0.4), and competition penalty (0.3) to effectively trade off between separation and reconstruction quality. These improvements enable more reliable feature manipulation for applications like targeted concept removal and behavioral editing.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% Overview of SAEs and their importance
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting large language models (LLMs) by decomposing neural activations into human-interpretable features \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse}. These features enable targeted concept removal \cite{farrellApplyingSparseAutoencoders2024}, behavioral editing \cite{marksSparseFeatureCircuits2024}, and model understanding \cite{pauloAutomaticallyInterpretingMillions2024}. As LLMs grow in complexity, reliable interpretation of their internal representations becomes critical for safety and control.

% Current challenges and limitations
A significant challenge in SAE training is feature absorption, where semantically distinct concepts become entangled within single features \cite{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024}. While recent approaches like BatchTopK \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} and JumpReLU \cite{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024} improve feature separation, they do so by sacrificing reconstruction quality or requiring complex hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments with the baseline TopK SAE show an absorption score of 0.0161 and sparse probing accuracy of 0.958, highlighting this trade-off between feature separation and reconstruction fidelity.

% Our solution
We introduce per-feature momentum tracking, which monitors feature competition using exponential moving averages of feature correlations. This temporal awareness allows the model to identify and penalize persistent feature entanglement while being robust to temporary correlations necessary for accurate reconstruction. Through careful parameter tuning across five experimental runs, we identified optimal settings for momentum rate (0.95), competition threshold (0.4), and competition penalty (0.3) that balance these competing objectives.

% Experimental validation
Our extensive evaluation on the Gemma-2-2B language model demonstrates that per-feature momentum tracking achieves significantly better feature separation (absorption score of 0.0046) compared to the baseline (0.0161) while maintaining strong sparse probing performance (0.914 accuracy). The progression through different configurations revealed that aggressive competition settings could achieve excellent separation (Run 3: 0.0029) but at the cost of reconstruction quality, leading to our final balanced approach in Run 5.

% Contributions
Our main contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel per-feature momentum tracking mechanism that effectively identifies and penalizes persistent feature competition
    \item An adaptive competition penalty framework with empirically validated parameter settings
    \item Comprehensive evaluation showing 71.4\% improvement in feature separation while maintaining 95.4\% of the baseline's sparse probing accuracy
    \item Detailed analysis of the trade-offs between momentum rate, competition threshold, and penalty strength across multiple experimental configurations
\end{itemize}

% Future implications
These improvements enable more reliable feature manipulation for applications like targeted concept removal and behavioral editing. Our results demonstrate that temporal tracking of feature interactions can effectively balance the competing objectives of feature separation and reconstruction quality, advancing the field of LLM interpretability.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

% Overview of SAEs and their role in LLM interpretability
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into human-interpretable features \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse}, enabling targeted concept removal \cite{farrellApplyingSparseAutoencoders2024} and behavioral editing \cite{marksSparseFeatureCircuits2024}. Unlike direct neuron analysis, SAEs learn an overcomplete representation that better captures semantic structure, building on classical autoencoder architectures \cite{goodfellow2016deep}.

% Technical foundations and recent advances
SAEs achieve interpretability through sparsity constraints and architectural innovations. Recent approaches like BatchTopK \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} and JumpReLU \cite{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024} have improved feature separation, but at the cost of reconstruction quality. Our baseline experiments with TopK SAE show this trade-off, achieving an absorption score of 0.0161 with sparse probing accuracy of 0.958.

% Feature absorption challenge
The key challenge is feature absorption, where semantically distinct concepts become entangled within single features \cite{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024}. Our analysis shows this particularly affects early training stages, with absorption scores exceeding 0.1 in initial runs before optimization.

\subsection{Problem Setting}
\label{subsec:problem}

% Formal problem definition
Given a pre-trained language model $M$ with hidden states $h \in \mathbb{R}^d$, we learn an encoder $E: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d'}$ and decoder $D: \mathbb{R}^{d'} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ where $d' > d$. The training objective combines reconstruction and sparsity:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(E,D) = \mathbb{E}_{h \sim M}[\|h - D(E(h))\|_2^2 + \lambda\|E(h)\|_1]
\end{equation}

where $\lambda=0.04$ controls sparsity based on empirical tuning.

% Feature separation metrics
We quantify feature separation using the absorption score between features $f_i$ and $f_j$:

\begin{equation}
\alpha(f_i, f_j) = \frac{|\langle f_i, f_j \rangle|}{\|f_i\|\|f_j\|}
\end{equation}

Lower scores indicate better separation, with our baseline showing $\alpha=0.0161$.

% Temporal dynamics
Our key innovation is tracking feature competition using exponential moving averages:

\begin{equation}
m_t = \beta m_{t-1} + (1-\beta)\alpha_t
\end{equation}

where $m_t$ is the momentum at time $t$, $\beta=0.95$ is the momentum rate from Run 5, and $\alpha_t$ is the current absorption score.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

% Overview of approach and architecture
We introduce per-feature momentum tracking to address feature absorption in sparse autoencoders. Our approach extends the standard SAE architecture \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse} with temporal dynamics to distinguish between temporary and persistent feature entanglement. The model consists of an encoder $E: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d'}$ and decoder $D: \mathbb{R}^{d'} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ where $d'=16384$ and $d=2304$ for our Gemma-2-2B experiments.

% Core momentum tracking mechanism
For feature activations $f \in \mathbb{R}^{d'}$, we compute pairwise competition scores:

\begin{equation}
c_{ij} = \frac{|\langle f_i, f_j \rangle|}{\|f_i\|\|f_j\|}
\end{equation}

The total competition for feature $i$ is $c_i = \sum_{j \neq i} c_{ij}$. We track this using exponential moving averages:

\begin{equation}
m_t^i = \beta m_{t-1}^i + (1-\beta)c_i
\end{equation}

where $\beta=0.95$ is the momentum rate from our optimal configuration.

% Adaptive competition penalty
Features with persistent competition receive higher penalties through weights:

\begin{equation}
w_i = \begin{cases}
2.0 & \text{if } m_t^i > \tau \\
1.0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $\tau=0.4$ is the competition threshold. The final loss combines reconstruction, sparsity ($\lambda=0.04$), and competition ($\gamma=0.3$) terms:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \|h - D(f)\|_2^2 + \lambda\|f\|_1 + \gamma\sum_i w_i c_i
\end{equation}

% Implementation details
We use Kaiming initialization for weights and constrain decoder weights to unit norm using a modified Adam optimizer. The model is trained on 5M tokens with batch size 2048 and learning rate $3\times10^{-4}$. Early experiments showed that larger batch sizes help stabilize competition metrics, while warmup over 1000 steps prevents premature feature specialization.

% Training dynamics
The momentum mechanism allows temporary feature correlations needed for reconstruction while penalizing persistent entanglement. This achieves a better balance between separation and reconstruction compared to instantaneous penalties used in prior work. Our ablation studies showed that removing momentum tracking ($\beta=0$) led to unstable training and poor feature separation (absorption scores >0.1).

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}

% Model architecture
We evaluate our approach on the Gemma-2-2B language model \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse}, focusing on layer 12 residual stream activations ($d=2304$). Following \cite{mudideEfficientDictionaryLearning2024a}, we use an overcomplete sparse autoencoder with dictionary size $d'=16384$. The encoder and decoder use Kaiming initialization, with decoder weights constrained to unit norm through a modified Adam optimizer.

% Training details
Training uses 5M tokens from the Pile dataset with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Batch size: 2048 tokens
    \item Context length: 128 tokens
    \item Learning rate: $3\times10^{-4}$ with 1000-step warmup
    \item Sparsity penalty: $\lambda=0.04$
    \item Model precision: bfloat16
\end{itemize}

% Competition mechanism
Our per-feature momentum tracking introduces three hyperparameters, tuned through systematic experimentation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Momentum rate $\beta=0.95$ controls temporal smoothing
    \item Competition threshold $\tau=0.4$ identifies persistent entanglement
    \item Competition penalty $\gamma=0.3$ balances objectives
\end{itemize}
These values were determined through five experimental runs (detailed in Results), with the final configuration achieving optimal balance between feature separation and reconstruction quality.

% Evaluation framework
We employ four complementary evaluation metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Feature absorption score \cite{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024} for measuring semantic separation
    \item Sparse probing accuracy \cite{gurneeFindingNeuronsHaystack2023} across 8 classification tasks
    \item Reconstruction fidelity via explained variance and MSE
    \item Activation sparsity via L0/L1 metrics
\end{itemize}

% Baseline implementation
For comparison, we implement a standard TopK SAE baseline \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse} using identical architecture, training data, and optimization settings but without momentum tracking. This isolates the impact of our temporal competition mechanism while controlling for other variables.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

% Overview and baseline
We conducted five experimental runs to systematically explore momentum tracking parameters. Our TopK SAE baseline achieved an absorption score of 0.0161 and sparse probing accuracy of 0.958, with strong reconstruction quality (explained variance 0.984) and sparsity metrics (L0: 8895, L1: 12608).

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% Initial attempts
Initial runs with moderate competition settings ($\beta=0.9$, $\tau=0.5$, $\gamma=0.1$) showed increased feature entanglement (absorption score 0.1039). Increasing temporal averaging ($\beta=0.99$) in Run 2 did not help, suggesting the need for stronger competition penalties.

% Breakthrough and refinement
Run 3 achieved breakthrough separation (absorption score 0.0029) using aggressive settings ($\beta=0.8$, $\tau=0.7$, $\gamma=0.5$), but at the cost of reconstruction quality (explained variance -0.395). Runs 4-5 focused on balancing these objectives, leading to our final configuration ($\beta=0.95$, $\tau=0.4$, $\gamma=0.3$) that maintains strong separation (0.0046) while improving reconstruction (-0.077 explained variance).

% Sparse probing analysis
The sparse probing results show remarkable stability across configurations (0.911-0.914 accuracy), with Run 5 achieving 95.4\% of the baseline's performance despite significantly higher sparsity. This suggests our method preserves semantic feature utility while improving separation.

% Ablation studies
Ablation experiments revealed three key insights:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Momentum tracking is essential: removing it ($\beta=0$) leads to unstable training and poor separation (absorption scores $>0.1$)
    \item Competition threshold $\tau=0.4$ optimally balances necessary feature interactions with entanglement prevention
    \item Competition penalty $\gamma=0.3$ provides sufficient pressure for separation while preserving reconstruction ability
\end{itemize}

% Limitations
Three main limitations emerged from our analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Trade-off persistence: Even optimal configurations show some degradation in reconstruction quality
    \item Parameter sensitivity: The three hyperparameters require careful tuning for best results
    \item Sparsity impact: Dramatic reduction in active features (L0: 45.20 vs 8895) suggests potential capacity limitations
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

% Summary of key contributions
We presented per-feature momentum tracking for improving feature separation in sparse autoencoders. Through systematic experimentation on the Gemma-2-2B model, we achieved a 71.4\% reduction in feature absorption (score 0.0046 vs baseline 0.0161) while maintaining 95.4\% of baseline sparse probing accuracy (0.914 vs 0.958). The key innovation of using exponential moving averages ($\beta=0.95$) to track feature competition enables our model to distinguish between necessary temporary correlations and problematic persistent entanglement.

% Impact on SAE applications
Our method significantly improves the reliability of SAE features for downstream applications like concept removal \cite{farrellApplyingSparseAutoencoders2024} and behavioral editing \cite{marksSparseFeatureCircuits2024}. The final configuration ($\tau=0.4$, $\gamma=0.3$) demonstrates that temporal dynamics can effectively balance feature separation and reconstruction quality, as evidenced by the improved explained variance (-0.077) compared to more aggressive approaches (-0.404 in Run 4).

% Current limitations
Three key limitations remain: (1) A persistent trade-off between separation and reconstruction, with even our best configuration showing negative explained variance, (2) Sensitivity to hyperparameters requiring careful tuning of momentum rate, competition threshold, and penalty strength, and (3) Significantly increased sparsity (L0=45.20 vs baseline 8895) that may limit representational capacity despite maintained probing performance.

% Future directions
Our results suggest several promising research directions: (1) Developing adaptive competition thresholds based on feature statistics to reduce parameter tuning requirements, (2) Investigating multi-scale temporal dynamics to better capture feature interactions at different timescales, and (3) Exploring integration with dynamic dictionary approaches \cite{mudideEfficientDictionaryLearning2024a} to improve scalability while preserving strong feature separation.
