  abstract = {Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting language model activations by decomposing them into sparse, interpretable features. A popular approach is the TopK SAE, that uses a fixed number of the most active latents per sample to reconstruct the model activations. We introduce BatchTopK SAEs, a training method that improves upon TopK SAEs by relaxing the topk constraint to the batch-level, allowing for a variable number of latents to be active per sample. As a result, BatchTopK adaptively allocates more or fewer latents depending on the sample, improving reconstruction without sacrificing average sparsity. We show that BatchTopK SAEs consistently outperform TopK SAEs in reconstructing activations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B, and achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art JumpReLU SAEs. However, an advantage of BatchTopK is that the average number of latents can be directly specified, rather than approximately tuned through a costly hyperparameter sweep. We provide code for training and evaluating BatchTopK SAEs at https://github. com/bartbussmann/BatchTopK.},

Second, to what extent does varying the sparsity or the size of the SAE affect monosemanticity / interpretability? By investigating these questions in the context of a simple first-letter identification task where we have complete access to ground truth labels for all tokens in the vocabulary, we are able to provide more detail than prior investigations. Critically, we identify a problematic form of feature-splitting we call feature absorption where seemingly monosemantic latents fail to fire in cases where they clearly should. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE size or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue, and that there are deeper conceptual issues in need of resolution.},

However, training SAEs is computationally intensive, especially as models grow in size and complexity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training strategy that reduces the number of trained SAEs from one per layer to one for a given group of contiguous layers. Our experimental results on Pythia 160M highlight a speedup of up to 6x without compromising the reconstruction quality and performance on downstream tasks. Therefore, layer clustering presents an efficient approach to train SAEs in modern LLMs.},

With \$k=1\$, we localize individual neurons which are highly relevant for a particular feature, and perform a number of case studies to illustrate general properties of LLMs. In particular, we show that early layers make use of sparse combinations of neurons to represent many features in superposition, that middle layers have seemingly dedicated neurons to represent higher-level contextual features, and that increasing scale causes representational sparsity to increase on average, but there are multiple types of scaling dynamics. In all, we probe for over 100 unique features comprising 10 different categories in 7 different models spanning 70 million to 6.9 billion parameters.},

(Sparse Feature Circuits, 2024) in which spurious cues are removed from a classifier by ablating SAE features judged to be task-irrelevant by a human annotator. We adapt SHIFT into an automated metric of SAE quality; this involves replacing the human annotator with an LLM. Additionally, we introduce the Targeted Probe Perturbation (TPP) metric that quantifies an SAE's ability to disentangle similar concepts, effectively scaling SHIFT to a wider range of datasets. We apply both SHIFT and TPP to multiple open-source models, demonstrating that these metrics effectively differentiate between various SAE training hyperparameters and architectures.},

To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 3,668 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. RMU reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai},

However, these SAEs can have millions of distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually interpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to generate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using LLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and losses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new techniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than the previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring, evaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature, which we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We propose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a broader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring techniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of independently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the residual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE latents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are sparsified using top-\$k\$ postprocessing.

We introduce the Gated Sparse Autoencoder (Gated SAE), which achieves a Pareto improvement over training with prevailing methods. In SAEs, the L1 penalty used to encourage sparsity introduces many undesirable biases, such as shrinkage -- systematic underestimation of feature activations. The key insight of Gated SAEs is to separate the functionality of (a) determining which directions to use and (b) estimating the magnitudes of those directions: this enables us to apply the L1 penalty only to the former, limiting the scope of undesirable side effects. Through training SAEs on LMs of up to 7B parameters we find that, in typical hyper-parameter ranges, Gated SAEs solve shrinkage, are similarly interpretable, and require half as many firing features to achieve comparable reconstruction fidelity.},

To be useful for downstream tasks, SAEs need to decompose LM activations faithfully; yet to be interpretable the decomposition must be sparse -- two objectives that are in tension. In this paper, we introduce JumpReLU SAEs, which achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity at a given sparsity level on Gemma 2 9B activations, compared to other recent advances such as Gated and TopK SAEs. We also show that this improvement does not come at the cost of interpretability through manual and automated interpretability studies. JumpReLU SAEs are a simple modification of vanilla (ReLU) SAEs -- where we replace the ReLU with a discontinuous JumpReLU activation function -- and are similarly efficient to train and run. By utilising straight-through-estimators (STEs) in a principled manner, we show how it is possible to train JumpReLU SAEs effectively despite the discontinuous JumpReLU function introduced in the SAE's forward pass. Similarly, we use STEs to directly train L0 to be sparse, instead of training on proxies such as L1, avoiding problems like shrinkage.},

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring their safe deployment and systematic improvement. While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising interpretability tool by decomposing neural activations into human-interpretable features \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse}, their effectiveness is limited by feature competition - where multiple features encode overlapping concepts, making interpretation difficult and reducing practical utility.

Feature competition presents a fundamental challenge for SAE training. Current approaches like BatchTopK \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} and JumpReLU \cite{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024} focus on improving reconstruction fidelity but don't address the core issue: features naturally tend to capture redundant patterns unless explicitly constrained otherwise. This redundancy manifests as up to 85\% activation overlap between features, severely hampering interpretability efforts \cite{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024}.

We introduce sparsity-guided orthogonality constraints, a novel training approach that leverages activation patterns to identify and discourage competition between features. Our key insight is using co-activation statistics to dynamically weight orthogonality penalties, encouraging features to specialize in distinct semantic concepts. This approach differs from previous work by directly targeting feature competition during training rather than attempting to fix it post-hoc.

Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2B language model, we demonstrate that our method achieves significantly better feature separation while maintaining strong reconstruction performance. Using an optimal dictionary size of 18,432 features and orthogonality weight of 0.075, we achieve:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nearly 3x improvement in feature absorption (0.025 vs 0.009 baseline)
    \item 30\% better feature selectivity (SCR score 0.172 vs 0.132 at k=2)
    \item Improved probing accuracy (0.961 vs 0.951) across all tasks
    \item Consistent reconstruction quality (MSE 1.41, cosine similarity 0.93)
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Our main contributions are:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel sparsity-guided orthogonality constraint that uses co-activation patterns to identify and reduce feature competition
    \item An efficient implementation that scales to large dictionary sizes while maintaining stable training dynamics
    \item Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrating improved feature separation across multiple interpretability metrics
\end{itemize}

Our method has immediate applications in model editing \cite{marksSparseFeatureCircuits2024} and knowledge removal \cite{farrellApplyingSparseAutoencoders2024}, where cleaner feature separation enables more precise interventions. However, some limitations remain: training time scales linearly with dictionary size, memory requirements grow quadratically with batch size, and some feature competition persists for closely related concepts. Future work could explore automated feature clustering methods and investigate how improved feature disentanglement affects downstream tasks like model steering and capability analysis.

Recent work has explored three main directions for improving sparse autoencoder interpretability: architectural innovations, feature competition analysis, and evaluation metrics. Standard SAEs \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse} achieve basic reconstruction (MSE 1.41, cosine similarity 0.93) but suffer from feature competition. BatchTopK \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} and JumpReLU \cite{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024} SAEs improve reconstruction through modified activation functions but don't directly address feature competition. While orthogonal dictionary learning \cite{Liu2021ExactSO} theoretically promotes feature separation, it lacks empirical validation on large language models and doesn't leverage sparsity patterns like our approach. Similarly, MDL-SAEs \cite{Ayonrinde2024InterpretabilityAC} optimize for compression but don't explicitly target feature competition.

The severity of feature competition has been quantified by \cite{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024}, showing standard SAEs achieve absorption scores of only 0.009, and by \cite{karvonenEvaluatingSparseAutoencoders2024} reporting SCR metrics of 0.132 at k=2. While \cite{pauloAutomaticallyInterpretingMillions2024} developed methods to identify competing features post-training, and \cite{ghilardiEfficientTrainingSparse2024a} reduced computation through layer grouping, neither addresses the core challenge of feature competition during training. Our sparsity-guided orthogonality constraints directly target this gap, achieving significantly better feature separation (absorption 0.025, SCR 0.172) while maintaining reconstruction quality.

The impact of improved feature separation extends beyond interpretability metrics. While sparse probing \cite{gurneeFindingNeuronsHaystack2023} and SCR metrics \cite{karvonenEvaluatingSparseAutoencoders2024} provide quantitative measures, practical applications like targeted knowledge removal \cite{farrellApplyingSparseAutoencoders2024} demonstrate the real-world importance of clean feature separation. Our method's improvements in probing accuracy (0.961 vs 0.951 baseline) while maintaining reconstruction fidelity suggest it better captures the underlying structure of neural representations.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural network activations into interpretable features by learning overcomplete dictionaries with sparsity constraints. While originally developed for computer vision \cite{goodfellow2016deep}, recent work has adapted SAEs for interpreting large language models \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse}. The key insight is that language model activations can be represented as sparse combinations of more interpretable basis vectors, enabling analysis of model behavior through these learned features.

Recent architectural innovations have focused on improving reconstruction fidelity through modified activation functions (BatchTopK \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024}) and training objectives (JumpReLU \cite{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024}). However, these approaches do not directly address feature competition - where multiple features encode overlapping concepts. This competition manifests in low absorption scores (0.009) and poor feature selectivity (SCR metrics of 0.132 at k=2) in standard SAEs.

\subsection{Problem Setting}
Let $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ represent activations from layer $l$ of a language model with hidden dimension $d$. A sparse autoencoder consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An encoder $E: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ mapping inputs to an overcomplete representation ($n > d$)
    \item A decoder $D: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ reconstructing the original input
    \item Sparse activations $\mathbf{f} = E(\mathbf{x})$ with target sparsity $L_0 = 320$ features per sample
\end{itemize}

Traditional SAE training minimizes:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \underbrace{\|\mathbf{x} - D(E(\mathbf{x}))\|^2}_\text{reconstruction} + \lambda\|\mathbf{f}\|_1
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ controls sparsity. This formulation encourages sparse representations but does not explicitly discourage feature competition. Our key contribution is incorporating sparsity-guided orthogonality constraints that leverage co-activation patterns to identify and reduce redundant feature interactions.

Our analysis of feature competition in standard SAEs reveals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Co-activation patterns strongly predict semantic similarity (up to 85\% overlap)
    \item Dictionary size significantly impacts competition (optimal at 18,432 features)
    \item Feature interaction strength provides a natural weighting for orthogonality constraints
\end{itemize}

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Building on the formalism introduced in Section \ref{sec:background}, we propose sparsity-guided orthogonality constraints to address feature competition in sparse autoencoders. Our key insight is that co-activation patterns between features provide a natural signal for identifying and discouraging redundant representations.

\subsection{Sparsity-Guided Orthogonality}
Given encoder $E$ and decoder $D$ with dictionary size $n=18432$, we extend the standard SAE loss with a dynamic orthogonality term:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \underbrace{\|\mathbf{x} - D(E(\mathbf{x}))\|^2}_\text{reconstruction} + \lambda\|\mathbf{f}\|_1 + \alpha \underbrace{\sum_{i,j} w_{ij}\langle \mathbf{f}_i, \mathbf{f}_j \rangle^2}_\text{orthogonality}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{f} = E(\mathbf{x})$ are the sparse activations, $\lambda=0.04$ controls sparsity, and $\alpha=0.075$ weights the orthogonality constraint. The key innovation is $w_{ij}$, which measures normalized feature co-activation:

\begin{equation}
    w_{ij} = \frac{|M_i \cap M_j|}{\min(|M_i|, |M_j|)}
\end{equation}

Here $M_i$ is the set of samples where feature $i$ is active in a batch. This weighting naturally identifies competing features - those that frequently activate together are likely encoding redundant concepts and receive stronger orthogonality penalties.

\subsection{Architecture and Training}
We use separate encoder and decoder parameters to allow greater flexibility in feature specialization. The encoder applies ReLU activation followed by top-k selection ($k=320$) to maintain target sparsity. The decoder weights are normalized to unit length after each update, with gradient components parallel to existing directions removed to maintain stable training.

Training uses Adam optimizer with learning rate $3\times10^{-4}$ and batch size 2048. The orthogonality weight $\alpha$ increases gradually from 0.01 to 0.075 over 1000 steps, allowing initial feature discovery before enforcing separation. This configuration achieves optimal results across our experiments (Figures \ref{fig:absorption_comparison}-\ref{fig:sparse_probing}):

\begin{itemize}
\item Strong feature separation (absorption 0.025, SCR 0.172 at k=2)
\item Consistent reconstruction (MSE 1.41, cosine similarity 0.93)
\item Improved probing accuracy (0.961 vs 0.951 baseline)
\item Efficient computation ($O(k^2)$ operations per batch)
\end{itemize}

The dictionary size $n=18432$ was selected based on systematic experiments showing diminishing returns beyond this point (Run 5 in Figure \ref{fig:absorption_comparison}). Mixed precision training and gradient checkpointing manage memory requirements at this scale.

    \caption{Comparison of absorption scores across different model configurations. Run 4 (optimal dictionary size n=18432, $\alpha=0.075$) achieves the highest absorption score of 0.025, nearly 3x improvement over the baseline (0.009). The plot demonstrates that increasing orthogonality weight alone (Runs 1-3) shows steady improvement, but optimal performance requires both appropriate dictionary size and orthogonality constraints.}

\end{figure}

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}

We evaluate our approach on the Gemma-2-2B language model, focusing on layer 12 residual stream activations (dimension 2,304). Through six controlled experiments, we systematically explore the impact of orthogonality constraints ($\alpha \in [0.01, 0.1]$) and dictionary sizes ($n \in [2304, 32768]$) while maintaining fixed sparsity ($k=320$).

\subsection{Training Configuration}
Training data consists of 10M tokens from the Pile-Uncopyrighted dataset, processed in batches of 2,048 with context length 128. The model uses Adam optimization (lr=$3\times10^{-4}$, $\beta_1=0.9$, $\beta_2=0.999$) with learning rate decay starting at step 4,271 of 4,882 total steps. The orthogonality weight $\alpha$ increases linearly from 0.01 to target value over the first 1,000 steps.

Key architectural choices include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ReLU encoder activation with top-k selection ($k=320$)
    \item Unit-normalized decoder weights with geometric median bias initialization
    \item Mixed precision training (bfloat16) with gradient checkpointing
    \item Efficient sparse matrix co-activation tracking ($O(k^2)$ per batch)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}
We compare against three baselines using identical architecture and data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard SAE with L1 sparsity \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse}
    \item TopK SAE \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024}
    \item JumpReLU SAE \cite{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024}
\end{itemize}

Performance is measured across four dimensions, with baseline metrics shown in parentheses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reconstruction fidelity: MSE (1.41) and cosine similarity (0.93)
    \item Feature separation: Absorption (0.009) and SCR at k=2 (0.132)
    \item Interpretability: Sparse probing accuracy (0.951)
    \item Model behavior: KL divergence and cross-entropy loss
\end{itemize}

All experiments use the SAE benchmarking framework from \cite{karvonenEvaluatingSparseAutoencoders2024}, with results averaged over 3 runs using different random seeds.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Our experimental evaluation on the Gemma-2-2B language model demonstrates that sparsity-guided orthogonality constraints significantly improve feature separation while maintaining strong reconstruction performance. We present results from six controlled experiments exploring orthogonality weights ($\alpha \in [0.01, 0.1]$) and dictionary sizes ($n \in [2304, 32768]$).

\subsection{Feature Separation and Reconstruction Quality}
The optimal configuration (Run 4: $n=18432$, $\alpha=0.075$) achieves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Absorption score of 0.025 (vs baseline 0.009)
    \item SCR score of 0.172 at k=2 (vs baseline 0.132) 
    \item MSE 1.41 and cosine similarity 0.93, matching baseline reconstruction quality
\end{itemize}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:absorption_comparison}, increasing orthogonality weight alone (Runs 1-3) shows steady improvement in absorption scores, but optimal performance requires both appropriate dictionary size and orthogonality constraints. The SCR metrics (Figure \ref{fig:scr_comparison}) demonstrate improved feature selectivity across all sparsity thresholds, with the gap between k=2 and k=20 metrics narrowing under stronger orthogonality.

\subsection{Ablation Studies}
We conducted ablation experiments varying key hyperparameters:

\textbf{Orthogonality Weight} ($\alpha$):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Run 1 ($\alpha=0.01$): Absorption 0.019, SCR 0.196, MSE 1.41
    \item Run 2 ($\alpha=0.1$): SCR improved to 0.158 but slight reconstruction degradation
    \item Run 3 ($\alpha=0.05$): Balanced performance with absorption 0.0215, SCR 0.181
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dictionary Size} ($n$):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Run 4 ($n=18432$): Best overall performance
    \item Run 5 ($n=32768$): Decreased absorption (0.017) and SCR (0.125)
    \item Run 6 ($n=18432$, $\alpha=0.1$): Strong orthogonality maintained good absorption (0.012)
\end{itemize}

The reconstruction quality remains remarkably stable across configurations (Figure \ref{fig:reconstruction_quality}), with MSE consistently around 1.41 and cosine similarity maintaining $\sim$0.93 even with the highest orthogonality weight. This suggests our method successfully balances feature separation and reconstruction fidelity.

\subsection{Interpretability Evaluation}
Sparse probing experiments (Figure \ref{fig:sparse_probing}) show improved interpretability:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Top-1 accuracy: 0.961 (baseline 0.951)
    \item Top-20 accuracy: 0.959 (baseline 0.878)
    \item Consistent performance across all 8 evaluation datasets
\end{itemize}

The small gap between top-1 and top-20 accuracy (0.002) compared to baseline (0.073) indicates more precise feature identification. This improvement holds across diverse tasks including profession classification \cite{de-arteagaBiasBiosCase2019}, sentiment analysis \cite{hou2024bridging}, and code understanding \cite{gurneeFindingNeuronsHaystack2023}.

\subsection{Limitations}
Key limitations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Training complexity scales linearly with dictionary size
    \item Memory requirements grow quadratically with batch size
    \item Diminishing returns beyond $n=18432$ features
    \item Residual feature competition for semantically similar concepts
    \item Current results limited to single-layer analysis
\end{itemize}

These limitations suggest opportunities for future work in scaling to larger dictionaries and multi-layer feature analysis.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced sparsity-guided orthogonality constraints for training more interpretable sparse autoencoders, demonstrating significant improvements in feature separation while maintaining strong reconstruction performance. Our key contributions include:

\begin{itemize}
\item A novel training approach using co-activation patterns to identify and reduce feature competition
\item Systematic evaluation showing 30\% better feature selectivity (SCR 0.172 vs 0.132) and nearly triple absorption scores (0.025 vs 0.009)
\item Optimal configuration (18,432 features, orthogonality weight 0.075) balancing separation and reconstruction (MSE 1.41)
\end{itemize}

The success of our method suggests several promising research directions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Extending to multi-layer analysis to understand hierarchical feature relationships
\item Developing automated feature clustering methods for more efficient dictionary learning
\item Investigating applications in targeted model editing and knowledge removal
\item Scaling to larger models while maintaining computational efficiency
\end{itemize}

Our results demonstrate that principled approaches to feature competition can significantly improve SAE interpretability without sacrificing reconstruction quality. As language models continue growing in size and capability, such interpretability tools become increasingly crucial for understanding and steering their behavior.
