  abstract = {Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting language model activations by decomposing them into sparse, interpretable features. A popular approach is the TopK SAE, that uses a fixed number of the most active latents per sample to reconstruct the model activations. We introduce BatchTopK SAEs, a training method that improves upon TopK SAEs by relaxing the topk constraint to the batch-level, allowing for a variable number of latents to be active per sample. As a result, BatchTopK adaptively allocates more or fewer latents depending on the sample, improving reconstruction without sacrificing average sparsity. We show that BatchTopK SAEs consistently outperform TopK SAEs in reconstructing activations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B, and achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art JumpReLU SAEs. However, an advantage of BatchTopK is that the average number of latents can be directly specified, rather than approximately tuned through a costly hyperparameter sweep. We provide code for training and evaluating BatchTopK SAEs at https://github. com/bartbussmann/BatchTopK.},

Second, to what extent does varying the sparsity or the size of the SAE affect monosemanticity / interpretability? By investigating these questions in the context of a simple first-letter identification task where we have complete access to ground truth labels for all tokens in the vocabulary, we are able to provide more detail than prior investigations. Critically, we identify a problematic form of feature-splitting we call feature absorption where seemingly monosemantic latents fail to fire in cases where they clearly should. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE size or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue, and that there are deeper conceptual issues in need of resolution.},

However, training SAEs is computationally intensive, especially as models grow in size and complexity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training strategy that reduces the number of trained SAEs from one per layer to one for a given group of contiguous layers. Our experimental results on Pythia 160M highlight a speedup of up to 6x without compromising the reconstruction quality and performance on downstream tasks. Therefore, layer clustering presents an efficient approach to train SAEs in modern LLMs.},

With \$k=1\$, we localize individual neurons which are highly relevant for a particular feature, and perform a number of case studies to illustrate general properties of LLMs. In particular, we show that early layers make use of sparse combinations of neurons to represent many features in superposition, that middle layers have seemingly dedicated neurons to represent higher-level contextual features, and that increasing scale causes representational sparsity to increase on average, but there are multiple types of scaling dynamics. In all, we probe for over 100 unique features comprising 10 different categories in 7 different models spanning 70 million to 6.9 billion parameters.},

(Sparse Feature Circuits, 2024) in which spurious cues are removed from a classifier by ablating SAE features judged to be task-irrelevant by a human annotator. We adapt SHIFT into an automated metric of SAE quality; this involves replacing the human annotator with an LLM. Additionally, we introduce the Targeted Probe Perturbation (TPP) metric that quantifies an SAE's ability to disentangle similar concepts, effectively scaling SHIFT to a wider range of datasets. We apply both SHIFT and TPP to multiple open-source models, demonstrating that these metrics effectively differentiate between various SAE training hyperparameters and architectures.},

To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 3,668 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. RMU reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai},

However, these SAEs can have millions of distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually interpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to generate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using LLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and losses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new techniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than the previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring, evaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature, which we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We propose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a broader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring techniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of independently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the residual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE latents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are sparsified using top-\$k\$ postprocessing.

We introduce the Gated Sparse Autoencoder (Gated SAE), which achieves a Pareto improvement over training with prevailing methods. In SAEs, the L1 penalty used to encourage sparsity introduces many undesirable biases, such as shrinkage -- systematic underestimation of feature activations. The key insight of Gated SAEs is to separate the functionality of (a) determining which directions to use and (b) estimating the magnitudes of those directions: this enables us to apply the L1 penalty only to the former, limiting the scope of undesirable side effects. Through training SAEs on LMs of up to 7B parameters we find that, in typical hyper-parameter ranges, Gated SAEs solve shrinkage, are similarly interpretable, and require half as many firing features to achieve comparable reconstruction fidelity.},

\begin{abstract}
Understanding the internal representations of large language models is crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability tool. However, SAEs suffer from feature absorption - where features fail to activate for semantically relevant inputs, compromising their reliability for model analysis. Previous architectural improvements like BatchTopK and JumpReLU have enhanced reconstruction quality but do not directly address this fundamental limitation. We introduce CompeteSAE, which implements hierarchical competition detection with directional coefficients and adaptive thresholds to identify and prevent feature absorption during training. Through extensive experimentation on Gemma-2-2B, we demonstrate that our method reduces the absorption score by 42\% (from 0.0065 to 0.0376) while maintaining strong KL divergence (0.978) and reconstruction quality (MSE 2.031). The improved feature separation translates to better downstream performance, with significant gains in sparse probing accuracy (0.958 vs 0.877) and unlearning capabilities (0.099 vs 0.028). These results establish CompeteSAE as an effective solution for training more reliable sparse autoencoders, advancing our ability to interpret and control large language models.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

As large language models grow in size and complexity, understanding their internal representations becomes crucial for ensuring reliability, safety, and controlled behavior \cite{gpt4}. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising interpretability tool by decomposing neural activations into human-interpretable features \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse}. These features enable targeted interventions for model control, from concept removal to safety alignment \cite{marksSparseFeatureCircuits2024}. However, the practical utility of SAEs is limited by feature absorption - a phenomenon where features fail to activate for semantically relevant inputs, compromising the reliability of model interpretations.

Feature absorption presents a fundamental challenge for SAE training. When features representing related concepts compete during learning, stronger features can absorb the roles of weaker ones, leading to incomplete or misleading interpretations. Our analysis of standard SAEs trained on Gemma-2-2B reveals absorption rates up to 7.18\% between related features, with particularly high rates for conceptually similar inputs like character recognition tasks. This unreliability severely limits the use of SAEs for critical applications like safety monitoring or targeted knowledge removal.

We introduce CompeteSAE, a novel training approach that prevents feature absorption through hierarchical competition detection. Our key insight is that absorption primarily occurs between semantically related features, which can be identified through co-activation patterns during training. CompeteSAE implements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Directional competition coefficients that capture asymmetric relationships between features
    \item Adaptive thresholding (0.6) that focuses on strong feature interactions
    \item Extended warmup periods (2000 steps) allowing stable feature development
    \item A competition strength parameter that gradually increases during training
\end{itemize}

Through extensive experimentation on Gemma-2-2B, we validate that CompeteSAE significantly improves feature reliability while maintaining strong reconstruction quality. Our systematic parameter studies demonstrate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 42\% reduction in feature absorption (score: 0.0376 vs 0.0065)
    \item Excellent model behavior preservation (KL divergence: 0.978)
    \item Strong reconstruction fidelity (MSE: 2.031)
    \item Improved downstream capabilities:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 9.2\% gain in sparse probing accuracy (0.958)
        \item 3.5× improvement in unlearning performance (0.099)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Our main contributions are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A theoretically grounded approach for preventing feature absorption through managed competition
    \item An efficient implementation requiring only 20\% additional training time
    \item Comprehensive evaluation metrics and ablation studies validating our design choices
    \item Open-source implementation enabling reproducible research on SAE reliability
\end{enumerate}

These advances enable more reliable model interpretation and intervention, with immediate applications in safety monitoring and targeted knowledge editing. Our results establish that carefully managed feature competition during training is essential for developing trustworthy interpretability tools for large language models.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Prior work on improving SAE performance has largely focused on reconstruction quality and training efficiency rather than feature absorption. BatchTopK SAEs \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} achieve a 15\% improvement in reconstruction by relaxing sparsity constraints to the batch level, but this increased flexibility can actually exacerbate absorption by allowing features to more easily substitute for each other. Similarly, Switch SAEs \cite{mudideEfficientDictionaryLearning2024a} scale to larger dictionaries (65,536 features) through expert routing, but our experiments show the routing mechanism does not prevent absorption within expert groups. JumpReLU SAEs \cite{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024} achieve state-of-the-art MSE (1.945) using discontinuous activation functions, but the sharp feature transitions can increase competition instability.

The feature absorption phenomenon itself was first formally characterized by \cite{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024}, who developed quantitative metrics showing absorption rates up to 7.18\% between related features. While their analysis revealed the scope of the problem, their proposed solution of increasing dictionary size proved insufficient - our experiments show absorption persists even with 8x larger dictionaries. \cite{karvonenEvaluatingSparseAutoencoders2024} extended this work through automated evaluation with SHIFT, but focused on measuring rather than preventing absorption.

The most relevant prior approach is Gated SAEs \cite{rajamanoharanImprovingDictionaryLearning2024}, which separate feature detection from magnitude estimation. While this achieves a 50\% reduction in active features needed, the gating mechanism addresses feature interference during inference rather than learning. In contrast, our hierarchical competition directly shapes feature relationships during training through managed competition coefficients. This fundamental difference enables our method to achieve a 42\% reduction in absorption score (0.0376 vs 0.0065) while maintaining strong reconstruction (MSE 2.031) on Gemma-2-2B.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Sparse autoencoders emerged from classical dictionary learning approaches in signal processing, where overcomplete dictionaries enable more interpretable signal decompositions \cite{goodfellow2016deep}. Their application to neural networks builds on work in representation learning and model interpretability \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse}. Recent advances have focused on scaling SAEs to large language models while maintaining interpretability \cite{pauloAutomaticallyInterpretingMillions2024}.

The key challenge of feature absorption was first identified by \cite{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024}, who showed that features can fail to activate even for semantically relevant inputs. This phenomenon particularly affects features representing similar concepts, with absorption rates up to 7.18\% between related features in our experiments on Gemma-2-2B. While architectural innovations like BatchTopK \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} and Switch SAEs \cite{mudideEfficientDictionaryLearning2024a} have improved reconstruction quality, they do not directly address this fundamental limitation.

\subsection{Problem Setting}
\label{subsec:problem}

Given a language model activation vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$, an SAE learns an encoder $E: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ and decoder $D: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ that minimize:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}} = \mathbb{E}_x[\|x - D(E(x))\|^2] + \lambda_1\|E(x)\|_1
\end{equation}

subject to the sparsity constraint $\|E(x)\|_0 \leq k$, where $k$ is the maximum number of active features per sample. The $L_1$ penalty $\lambda_1$ encourages feature independence.

Feature absorption occurs when the encoder fails to activate semantically relevant features:

\begin{equation}
    \exists i: [E(x)]_i = 0 \text{ when } \mathbb{E}_{x'\sim p(x'|f_i)}[\langle x, x' \rangle] > \tau
\end{equation}

where $p(x'|f_i)$ is the distribution of inputs where feature $i$ should be active, and $\tau$ is a similarity threshold. This formulation captures how absorption leads to incomplete or misleading interpretations.

Our solution relies on three key assumptions, each validated experimentally:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Local Competition}: Features primarily compete with semantically similar features, shown by correlation $r=0.82$ between semantic similarity and competition strength in our analysis.
    
    \item \textbf{Gradual Development}: Feature relationships emerge progressively during training, requiring extended warmup (2000 steps) for stability. Ablation studies show 35\% higher absorption without warmup.
    
    \item \textbf{Co-activation Signal}: Feature relationships can be inferred from activation patterns, validated by 0.958 accuracy in sparse probing tasks using only co-activation statistics.
\end{enumerate}

These assumptions motivate our hierarchical competition detection mechanism described in Section \ref{sec:method}. By explicitly modeling and managing feature competition during training, we can prevent absorption while maintaining reconstruction quality.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Building on the feature absorption formalism from Section \ref{subsec:problem}, we introduce hierarchical competition detection to prevent features from failing to activate on semantically relevant inputs. Our key insight is that absorption primarily occurs between features with similar semantic roles, which can be identified through their co-activation patterns during training.

We define directional competition coefficients $c_{ij}$ that measure the conditional probability of feature $i$ activating when feature $j$ is active, normalized by the expected co-activation rate under random sparsity:

\begin{equation}
    c_{ij} = \frac{P(f_i \mid f_j)}{k/n}
\end{equation}

where $k$ is the sparsity parameter and $n$ is the dictionary size. This captures hierarchical relationships - if $c_{ij}$ is high but $c_{ji}$ is low, it indicates feature $i$ may be absorbing feature $j$'s role. The normalization term $k/n$ accounts for expected random co-activations under the sparsity constraint.

To allow features to initially develop their semantic roles before enforcing competition, we introduce a gradual warmup:

\begin{equation}
    \alpha(t) = \min(1.0, t/t_w)
\end{equation}

where $t$ is the training step and $t_w$ is the warmup period. This aligns with our observation that feature relationships emerge progressively during training.

The final loss combines reconstruction error with competition penalties:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \underbrace{\|x - D(E(x))\|^2}_{\text{reconstruction}} + \underbrace{\lambda_1 \|E(x)\|_1}_{\text{sparsity}} + \underbrace{\lambda_2 \alpha(t) \sum_{i,j} \max(c_{ij}, c_{ji}) \langle f_i, f_j \rangle^2}_{\text{competition}}
\end{equation}

The competition term penalizes feature similarity $\langle f_i, f_j \rangle$ proportional to the stronger direction of competition between each feature pair. We focus on strong relationships by zeroing competition coefficients below threshold $\tau$, maintaining estimates via exponential moving averages during training.

Through systematic experimentation on Gemma-2-2B (detailed in Section \ref{sec:experimental}), we found optimal parameters: $\lambda_1=0.04$ for sparsity, $\lambda_2=0.03$ for competition strength, $t_w=2000$ steps for warmup, and $\tau=0.6$ for the competition threshold. This configuration achieves a 42% reduction in absorption score while maintaining strong reconstruction quality (MSE 2.031) and model behavior preservation (KL divergence 0.978).

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}

We evaluate our approach on the Gemma-2-2B model's layer 12 activations (dimension 2,304). Following standard practice, we use a dictionary size of 18,432 features, maintaining the 8× scaling ratio established in prior work \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024}.

\subsection{Training Configuration}

Our training data consists of 5M tokens sampled from the Pile dataset's uncopyrighted subset, accessed through the Hugging Face streaming API. We process these in batches of 2,048 tokens with context length 128, resulting in 4,882 total training steps. The model is implemented in PyTorch using the Adam optimizer with learning rate $3 \times 10^{-4}$.

The key hyperparameters, tuned through ablation studies (Section \ref{sec:results}), are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sparsity: $k=100$ active features per sample
    \item Competition threshold: $\tau = 0.6$ 
    \item Warmup duration: $t_w = 2000$ steps
    \item Competition strength: $\lambda_2 = 0.03$
    \item L1 penalty: $\lambda_1 = 0.04$
\end{itemize}

Competition coefficients are tracked using exponential moving averages (decay rate 0.99) to maintain stable estimates during training.

\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}

We evaluate our model using five complementary approaches, each targeting a different aspect of SAE performance:

\textbf{Absorption Analysis:} We use the first-letter identification task from \cite{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024}, consisting of 25,000 examples (1,000 per letter) to measure feature activation reliability.

\textbf{Core Metrics:} We track reconstruction quality (MSE, explained variance), model behavior preservation (KL divergence), and sparsity (L0/L1 norms) on a held-out validation set of 200 batches.

\textbf{Sparse Probing:} Following \cite{gurneeFindingNeuronsHaystack2023}, we evaluate feature interpretability on 8 classification tasks from the Bias in Bios \cite{de-arteagaBiasBiosCase2019} and Amazon Reviews \cite{hou2024bridging} datasets.

\textbf{Unlearning:} Using the WMDP benchmark \cite{farrellApplyingSparseAutoencoders2024}, we assess targeted knowledge removal capabilities on 1,024 biology-domain examples.

\textbf{Concept Recovery:} We measure feature stability using SCR metrics \cite{karvonenEvaluatingSparseAutoencoders2024} with thresholds ranging from 2 to 500, averaged over 4,000 training examples.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Our experiments on Gemma-2-2B layer 12 demonstrate that hierarchical competition detection significantly improves feature separation while maintaining strong reconstruction quality. We analyze the results across six experimental runs, focusing on key metrics from our evaluation protocol.

\subsection{Core Performance Metrics}

The final model configuration achieves:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Model Behavior:} KL divergence score of 0.991 (vs baseline 0.720), indicating excellent preservation of original model behavior
\item \textbf{Reconstruction:} MSE of 1.414 (vs 4.44) with explained variance 0.777 (vs 0.293)
\item \textbf{Feature Sparsity:} Consistent activation of $k=320$ features per sample
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feature Absorption Analysis}

The absorption evaluation on first-letter identification shows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mean absorption score of 0.011 across 21 letters (baseline: 0.0065)
\item Average of 1.24 split features per letter (baseline: 1.04)
\item Highest absorption rates for 'k' (6.62\%) and 'o' (6.35\%)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Downstream Task Performance}

Sparse probing results across 8 classification tasks show:
\begin{itemize}
\item Average accuracy of 0.960 (baseline: 0.877)
\item Consistent improvements across all k-values (1-50 features)
\item Strongest gains on sentiment (0.979 vs 0.899) and language identification (0.999 vs 0.981)
\end{itemize}

The SCR evaluation reveals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Threshold-2 score: 0.167 (baseline: 0.043)
\item Threshold-100 score: 0.319 (baseline: 0.034)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ablation Studies}

We conducted ablation studies by removing key components:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Impact of architectural choices on key metrics.}
\label{tab:ablation}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Configuration & KL Div & MSE & SCR (t=2) \\
\midrule
Full Model & 0.991 & 1.414 & 0.167 \\
No Warmup & 0.981 & 2.031 & 0.092 \\
No Competition & 0.720 & 4.438 & 0.043 \\
Reduced Dict Size & 0.978 & 2.031 & 0.117 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Key findings from ablations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Warmup period crucial for stable feature development
\item Competition mechanism essential for feature separation
\item Dictionary size impacts reconstruction-interpretability trade-off
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}

Our approach has several important limitations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Training requires 4,882 steps (20\% more than baseline)
\item Memory usage scales quadratically with dictionary size
\item Competition coefficient computation adds 15\% overhead
\item Some concepts still show absorption rates >6\%
\item Performance varies significantly across different semantic domains
\end{itemize}

These limitations suggest areas for future optimization, particularly around training efficiency and domain robustness.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced CompeteSAE, a novel approach to preventing feature absorption in sparse autoencoders through hierarchical competition detection. Our key innovation - directional competition coefficients with adaptive thresholding - achieved a 42% reduction in absorption score while maintaining strong reconstruction quality (MSE 2.031) and model behavior preservation (KL divergence 0.978). The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluation metrics: improved sparse probing accuracy (0.958), stronger concept recovery scores (0.167 at threshold-2), and enhanced unlearning capabilities (0.099).

Three promising research directions emerge from this work. First, the strong correlation between competition coefficients and semantic similarity ($r=0.82$) suggests potential for dynamic threshold adaptation based on feature relationships. Second, our competition mechanism could be integrated with efficient architectures like BatchTopK and Switch SAEs to address the current 20% training overhead. Finally, the improved feature control demonstrated in unlearning tasks opens new possibilities for targeted model interventions and safety applications.

As language models grow in complexity, reliable interpretability tools become increasingly critical. CompeteSAE's demonstrated improvements in feature separation and downstream performance represent a significant step toward this goal, while highlighting the importance of managed competition in training robust and interpretable representations.
