    "Summary": "The paper proposes a novel selective feature decorrelation approach for training interpretable sparse autoencoders, aimed at addressing feature entanglement in large language models. The method reduces computational complexity and includes an adaptive threshold mechanism that eliminates manual hyperparameter tuning. Initial experiments with the Gemma-2B model show improved feature separation and reconstruction fidelity, but significant engineering challenges hindered successful implementation.",
