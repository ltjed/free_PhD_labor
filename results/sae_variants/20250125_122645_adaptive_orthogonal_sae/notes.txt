# Title: Instantaneous Top-k Orthogonality Constraints for Feature Disentanglement

# Visualization Analysis (training_comparison.png)
The experiment results are visualized in a comprehensive multi-panel figure (training_comparison.png) containing four key plots:

1. Adaptive τ History (Top Panel)
   - Shows the evolution of the τ threshold over training steps
   - Y-axis: τ value (orthogonality threshold)
   - X-axis: Training steps
   - Higher τ values indicate stricter orthogonality constraints
   - Adaptive behavior visible through τ adjustments based on feature correlations

2. Feature Correlation Distribution (Second Panel)
   - Displays mean correlation between feature pairs with standard deviation bands
   - Y-axis: Mean correlation value
   - X-axis: Training steps
   - Shaded regions represent ±1 standard deviation
   - Lower mean correlations indicate better feature disentanglement
   - Width of shaded region indicates correlation stability

3. Training Progress (Third Panel)
   - Tracks successful training steps over time
   - Y-axis: Cumulative successful steps
   - X-axis: Step attempts
   - Linear progression indicates stable training
   - Plateaus suggest training difficulties
   - Helps identify stalled or failed training runs

4. Training Loss (Bottom Panel)
   - Shows the overall loss evolution during training
   - Y-axis: Loss value (log scale)
   - X-axis: Training steps
   - Combines reconstruction loss, sparsity penalty, and orthogonality loss
   - Log scale helps visualize both early and late training dynamics
   - Convergence indicated by loss stabilization

Key Insights from Visualizations:
- Correlation between τ adaptation and feature disentanglement
- Impact of orthogonality constraints on training stability
- Relationship between loss reduction and feature independence
- Effectiveness of adaptive τ mechanism in maintaining desired feature properties
