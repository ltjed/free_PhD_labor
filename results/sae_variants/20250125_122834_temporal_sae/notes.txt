## Figure: hyperparameters.png
This figure presents two side-by-side plots comparing key hyperparameters:

1. Learning Rate Comparison (Left Plot):
   - Bar chart showing learning rates used in each approach
   - Hierarchical Architecture used standard learning rate (3e-4)
   - Curriculum Learning used adaptive rates based on training phase
   - Demonstrates how learning rate adaptation affects training stability

Description: Baseline results with standard SAE configuration.

## Run 1: Initial Position-Specific Masking
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}
Description: First attempt at implementing position-specific masking. The training did not complete successfully, indicating potential issues with the initialization or gradient flow through the position-specific masks. The next run will focus on implementing soft masking instead of hard binary masks to potentially improve gradient propagation.

## Run 2: Soft Gaussian Masking Implementation
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}
Description: Implemented soft Gaussian masking with sigma=context_length/8 for smoother position-specific feature learning. Training still failed to complete successfully. Analysis suggests potential issues with the interaction between the position-specific masks and the L1 sparsity penalty. The next run will adjust the L1 penalty application to work more harmoniously with the positional masking by applying it after the position-specific masks.

## Run 3: Separated ReLU and Masking with Modified L1 Penalty
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}
Description: Modified the architecture to separate ReLU activation and positional masking in the encode() method, while applying L1 sparsity penalty on raw activations before masking. This change was intended to improve the interaction between position-specific masks and the L1 sparsity penalty. However, training still failed to complete successfully. The persistent training failures across multiple architectural modifications suggest we should investigate potential numerical stability issues. For Run 4, we will implement gradient clipping and reduce the learning rate to stabilize training.

## Run 4: Gradient Clipping and Learning Rate Reduction
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}
Description: Implemented gradient clipping with max_norm=1.0 and reduced the learning rate by a factor of 10 to address potential training instability. Despite these changes aimed at numerical stability, training still failed to complete successfully. The consistent training failures across different approaches suggest we may need to investigate the fundamental architecture. For Run 5, we will try a different approach by implementing layer normalization before the positional masking to ensure better-conditioned activations and more stable training dynamics.

## Run 5: Layer Normalization Implementation
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}
Description: Added layer normalization before the positional masking to stabilize activations. Despite this addition, training continues to fail. The persistent failures across multiple stability-focused modifications (gradient clipping, learning rate reduction, and now layer normalization) suggest that the core issue may lie in the interaction between the positional masking mechanism and the optimization process. For Run 6, we will implement a progressive training schedule where the positional masking is gradually introduced during training, starting with standard SAE training and slowly increasing the influence of position-specific masks.

## Run 6: Progressive Mask Training
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}
Description: Implemented a progressive training schedule using a learnable mask coefficient that gradually increases the influence of position-specific masks during training. The coefficient is transformed through a sigmoid function to ensure smooth transitions between unmasked and masked states. Despite this more gradual approach to introducing positional constraints, training still failed to complete successfully. The consistent failures across multiple architectural variations and training strategies suggest that the fundamental assumption about position-specific feature learning through masking may need to be reconsidered. For Run 7, we will try an alternative approach using separate encoder weights for different position ranges, effectively creating position-specialized sub-dictionaries while maintaining a shared decoder.

## Run 7: Position-Range Specific Encoders
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}
Description: Implemented a novel architecture using separate encoder weights for different position ranges while maintaining a shared decoder. The context window was divided into 4 ranges, with each range having its own specialized encoder weights for a portion of the dictionary. This approach aimed to enforce position-specific feature learning through architectural constraints rather than masking. The training still failed to complete successfully, suggesting potential issues with the initialization or optimization of the range-specific encoders. For Run 8, we will implement a more sophisticated initialization scheme for the range-specific encoders using orthogonal initialization and add position embeddings to help distinguish between different ranges during training.

## Run 8: Orthogonal Initialization and Position Embeddings
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}
Description: Enhanced the position-range specific encoder architecture with orthogonal initialization for both encoder and decoder weights to ensure better gradient flow. Added learnable position embeddings for each range to help the model distinguish between different positions during training. Modified the layer normalization placement to before ReLU activation for better training stability. Despite these sophisticated initialization and architectural improvements, training continued to fail. The persistent failures across multiple architectural variations suggest that the position-specific learning approach may be fundamentally challenging for the autoencoder framework. For Run 9, we will try a completely different approach using a hierarchical structure where we first learn position-agnostic features, then train position-specific adaptation layers on top of these features.

## Run 9: Hierarchical Architecture with Position-Specific Adaptations
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}
Description: Implemented a hierarchical architecture with two main components: (1) a base encoder-decoder for learning position-agnostic features, and (2) position-specific adaptation layers with gated residual connections. The base encoder-decoder used orthogonal initialization to ensure good gradient flow, while the adaptation layers were implemented as small MLPs with layer normalization. A gating mechanism was added to control the influence of position-specific adaptations. Despite this sophisticated design incorporating lessons from previous runs, training still failed to complete successfully. The continued training instability suggests that we need to focus on the fundamentals of the training process before adding architectural complexity. For Run 10, we will implement a curriculum learning approach where we first train the base encoder-decoder without any position-specific components, then gradually introduce the adaptation layers with careful initialization and scaled learning rates.
