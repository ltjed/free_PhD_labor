    "Summary": "The paper proposes a hierarchical feature adaptation framework to introduce position-awareness into sparse autoencoders. It aims to capture position-specific patterns while maintaining training stability and feature interpretability. The approach involves learning stable position-agnostic features first and then gradually adapting them through curriculum learning using specialized position-range encoders. Experimental results on the Gemma-2B model show improved performance on position-sensitive tasks compared to baseline methods.",
