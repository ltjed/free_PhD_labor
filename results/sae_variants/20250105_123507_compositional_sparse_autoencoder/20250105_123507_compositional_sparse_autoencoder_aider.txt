#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Compositional Sparse Autoencoders: Learning Interpretable Feature Combinations in Language Models.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: 1. Architecture modifications:  
####    - Two-stream architecture: feature extractor (d_f=256) and composition network (d_c=128)  
####    - Multi-head attention (8 heads) for feature composition  
####    - Residual connections with gating mechanism  
####    - Bottleneck layer enforcing sparsity (k=32)  
#### 2. Training procedure:  
####    - End-to-end training with graduated sparsity  
####    - Batch size 512, learning rate 3e-4  
####    - Composition complexity curriculum (2->4 feature combinations)  
#### 3. Evaluation framework:  
####    - Synthetic tests: arithmetic, boolean logic, simple grammar  
####    - Feature interaction analysis via attention patterns  
####    - Human evaluation (n=50) of feature interpretability  
####    - Comparison with PCA, NMF, and standard sparse AE  
#### 4. Analysis:  
####    - Ablation studies on architecture components  
####    - Composition pattern visualization  
####    - Feature reuse statistics.  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'shakespeare_char': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.8083514968554179, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.4693279266357422, 'total_train_time_mean': 301.409769932429, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 476.76571942025066}, 'enwik8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9414697289466858, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.0054575204849243, 'total_train_time_mean': 2371.9740512371063, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 481.0998539249739}, 'text8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9939898252487183, 'best_val_loss_mean': 0.9801777005195618, 'total_train_time_mean': 2351.458997964859, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 476.5669066097941}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.

I'll help plan and implement the compositional sparse autoencoder experiments. Based on the requirements, here's my proposed plan for the 5 runs:

Run 1: Implement the basic compositional architecture
- Two-stream architecture with feature extractor and composition network
- Multi-head attention for composition
- Basic residual connections and gating
- Initial sparsity level k=32

Run 2: Add graduated sparsity training
- Start with k=64 and gradually reduce to k=32
- Implement curriculum learning for composition complexity
- Start with 2 feature combinations, increase to 4

Run 3: Ablation study - Remove components
- No multi-head attention (single head)
- No residual connections
- Compare against Run 1 results

Run 4: Ablation study - Architecture variations  
- Vary feature extractor dimension (d_f=128)
- Vary composition network dimension (d_c=64)
- Compare against Run 1 results

Run 5: Comparison baselines
- Add PCA baseline
- Add NMF baseline
- Compare against vanilla SAE baseline

Let's start with Run 1 by implementing the basic compositional architecture. I'll modify the VanillaSAE class to create a CompositionalSAE class.

Here are the changes for Run 1:

This implements Run 1 with:
1. Two-stream architecture (feature extractor d_f=256, composition network d_c=128)
2. Multi-head attention (8 heads) for feature composition
3. Residual connections with gating mechanism
4. Bottleneck layer enforcing sparsity (k=32)

The key changes are:
- Added CompositionalSAE class with two processing streams
- Implemented multi-head attention for feature composition
- Added gating mechanism and residual connections
- Added top-k sparsification
- Updated trainer class name

To run this first experiment:

```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```

After we get the results from Run 1, we can proceed with implementing Run 2 which will add graduated sparsity and curriculum learning.

The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc

# The other 2 SEARCH/REPLACE blocks were applied successfully.
Don't re-send them.
Just reply with fixed versions of the block above that failed to match.  

Let me fix that SEARCH/REPLACE block with the exact match from the file:

The issue was missing the extra space after the comment. Now it should match exactly.

The error occurs because we're trying to use VanillaSAE but we should be using CompositionalSAE since this is the CompositionalTrainer. Let me fix that:

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Initialize autoencoder
        self.ae = VanillaSAE(d_in=activation_dim, d_sae=dict_size)
=======
        # Initialize autoencoder
        self.ae = CompositionalSAE(d_in=activation_dim, d_sae=dict_size)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change makes the trainer use the CompositionalSAE class we defined earlier in the file instead of the undefined VanillaSAE class.
