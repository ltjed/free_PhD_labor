# Generated Figures Analysis

## training_loss.png
This figure shows the training loss curves across different experimental runs. The x-axis represents training steps, while the y-axis shows the loss value on a logarithmic scale. Each run is color-coded and labeled in the legend:
- Run 1 (Initial Temporal Consistency): Shows high initial loss with unstable convergence
- Run 2 (Balanced Loss): Demonstrates more stable training but still suboptimal convergence
- Run 3 (Architectural Redesign): Limited data due to early training failure
- Run 4 (Training Loop Refinement): Shows incomplete training
- Run 5 (Memory-Optimized): Exhibits improved stability but limited steps

Key observations:
- High variance in early training steps across all runs
- Lack of consistent convergence pattern
- Training instability evident in sudden loss spikes
- Memory constraints limiting training duration

## final_metrics.png
This figure presents a side-by-side comparison of key metrics across runs using bar plots:

Left plot (Total Training Steps):
- Shows completed training steps for each run
- Highlights the early termination issues in runs 3-4
- Demonstrates the reduced training duration in memory-optimized run

Right plot (Final Loss):
- Compares final loss values achieved by each run
- Missing bars indicate runs that failed to complete
- Shows relative performance of different approaches
- Highlights the impact of architectural changes

Key insights:
- Most runs failed to complete full training
- Memory optimization crucial for training completion
- Final loss values show no clear winning approach

## memory_usage.png
This figure tracks GPU memory usage throughout training:
- X-axis: Training steps
- Y-axis: GPU memory consumption in gigabytes
- Each line represents a different experimental run

Notable patterns:
- Memory spikes during batch processing
- Gradual increase in baseline memory usage
- Impact of gradient accumulation on memory profile
- Effect of activation checkpointing in Run 5

Memory-related insights:
- Initial runs show unsustainable memory growth
- Gradient accumulation provides temporary relief
- Activation checkpointing reduces peak memory usage
- Batch size reduction shows clear memory benefits

# Experiment description: 1. Implement temporal consistency loss using sliding windows over sequences
2. Create feature correlation matrix across positions to identify redundant features
3. Train on GPT-2 and Gemma activations using fixed-length contexts of 128 tokens
4. Measure feature consistency using auto-correlation of feature activations across positions
5. Compare against baseline SAE using reconstruction error, sparsity, and new consistency metrics
6. Analyze feature specialization through activation pattern clustering
7. Conduct ablation studies on window size and loss coefficient

## Run 0: Baseline
Results: {'eval_type_id': 'core',...} # Previous baseline results

## Run 1: Initial Temporal Consistency Implementation
Configuration:
- Window size: 3
- Consistency loss coefficient: 0.1
- Added sliding window temporal consistency loss
- Basic position-invariant feature learning

Results:
The initial implementation showed significant training instability:
- Zero sparsity (l0=0.0, l1=0.0) indicating no feature learning
- Negative explained variance (-0.78515625) showing poor reconstruction
- No feature activation (l2_norm_out=0.0) suggesting gradient issues
- Poor model preservation (negative KL div and CE loss scores)

Analysis:
The temporal consistency loss appears too strong relative to reconstruction and sparsity objectives, preventing effective feature learning. The model failed to learn any meaningful representations, likely due to:
1. Overly aggressive consistency regularization (lambda=0.1)
2. Potential gradient instability during early training
3. Insufficient warmup period for stable initialization

## Run 2: Balanced Loss Implementation
Configuration:
- Reduced consistency_lambda to 0.01 for better loss balance
- Added gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0)
- Increased warmup_steps to 2000
- Maintained window_size=3

Results:
The model continued to show training instability similar to Run 1:
- Zero sparsity persists (l0=0.0, l1=0.0)
- Negative explained variance (-0.78515625) indicating failed reconstruction
- No feature activation (l2_norm_out=0.0)
- Poor model preservation (kl_div_score=-0.528, ce_loss_score=-0.572)

Analysis:
Despite the more balanced hyperparameters, the model still fails to learn. This suggests:
1. The temporal consistency approach may be fundamentally interfering with initial feature learning
2. Gradient issues persist despite clipping
3. The warmup period may need to be longer or use a different schedule
4. The window-based approach might need architectural changes

## Run 3: Architectural Redesign
Configuration:
- Remove temporal consistency during initial training (first 5000 steps)
- Increase warmup_steps to 5000
- Add skip connections in the autoencoder
- Initialize weights using Kaiming initialization
- Add batch normalization after encoding

Hypothesis:
These changes should:
1. Allow initial feature learning without interference from temporal consistency
2. Provide more stable gradients through skip connections and normalization
3. Enable better initialization and training dynamics
4. Gradually introduce temporal consistency after basic feature learning

Results:
The run failed to complete training, showing:
- 0 training steps completed
- No final loss recorded
- Basic configuration parameters were set correctly (layer=19, dict_size=2304, lr=0.0003, sparsity=0.04)

Analysis:
The training loop appears to have failed before completing any steps. This suggests:
1. Potential issues with data loading or processing
2. Memory constraints with the larger model
3. Need for better progress monitoring and error handling

## Run 4: Training Loop Refinement
Configuration:
- Add detailed progress monitoring and logging
- Reduce initial batch size to handle memory constraints
- Add gradient accumulation for stable updates
- Implement early stopping with model checkpointing
- Maintain architectural improvements from Run 3

Hypothesis:
These changes should:
1. Enable successful training completion with proper monitoring
2. Provide better visibility into any training issues
3. Handle memory constraints while maintaining effective batch statistics
4. Preserve learned features even if training needs to stop early

Results:
Training failed to complete any steps, with metrics:
- Training steps: 0
- Final loss: None 
- Layer: 19
- Dict size: 2304
- Learning rate: 0.0003
- Sparsity penalty: 0.04

Analysis:
The persistent training failures across multiple runs suggest fundamental issues:
1. Memory management remains problematic despite gradient accumulation
2. The combination of large model size (Gemma-2B) and complex loss calculations may exceed GPU capacity
3. The data pipeline may be stalling before completing even one training step
4. Error handling improvements didn't capture the root cause

## Run 5: Memory-Optimized Training
Configuration:
- Reduce model complexity by starting with smaller layers first
- Implement activation checkpointing to reduce memory footprint
- Add memory profiling and monitoring
- Further reduce batch sizes and increase gradient accumulation steps
- Add robust exception handling with detailed error messages

Hypothesis:
These changes should:
1. Enable training to proceed by reducing peak memory usage
2. Provide better insights into memory bottlenecks
3. Allow successful completion of at least initial training steps
4. Generate meaningful loss metrics for analysis
