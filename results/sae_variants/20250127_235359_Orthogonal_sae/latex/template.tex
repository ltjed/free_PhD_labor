  abstract = {Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting language model activations by decomposing them into sparse, interpretable features. A popular approach is the TopK SAE, that uses a fixed number of the most active latents per sample to reconstruct the model activations. We introduce BatchTopK SAEs, a training method that improves upon TopK SAEs by relaxing the topk constraint to the batch-level, allowing for a variable number of latents to be active per sample. As a result, BatchTopK adaptively allocates more or fewer latents depending on the sample, improving reconstruction without sacrificing average sparsity. We show that BatchTopK SAEs consistently outperform TopK SAEs in reconstructing activations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B, and achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art JumpReLU SAEs. However, an advantage of BatchTopK is that the average number of latents can be directly specified, rather than approximately tuned through a costly hyperparameter sweep. We provide code for training and evaluating BatchTopK SAEs at https://github. com/bartbussmann/BatchTopK.},

Second, to what extent does varying the sparsity or the size of the SAE affect monosemanticity / interpretability? By investigating these questions in the context of a simple first-letter identification task where we have complete access to ground truth labels for all tokens in the vocabulary, we are able to provide more detail than prior investigations. Critically, we identify a problematic form of feature-splitting we call feature absorption where seemingly monosemantic latents fail to fire in cases where they clearly should. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE size or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue, and that there are deeper conceptual issues in need of resolution.},

However, training SAEs is computationally intensive, especially as models grow in size and complexity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training strategy that reduces the number of trained SAEs from one per layer to one for a given group of contiguous layers. Our experimental results on Pythia 160M highlight a speedup of up to 6x without compromising the reconstruction quality and performance on downstream tasks. Therefore, layer clustering presents an efficient approach to train SAEs in modern LLMs.},

With \$k=1\$, we localize individual neurons which are highly relevant for a particular feature, and perform a number of case studies to illustrate general properties of LLMs. In particular, we show that early layers make use of sparse combinations of neurons to represent many features in superposition, that middle layers have seemingly dedicated neurons to represent higher-level contextual features, and that increasing scale causes representational sparsity to increase on average, but there are multiple types of scaling dynamics. In all, we probe for over 100 unique features comprising 10 different categories in 7 different models spanning 70 million to 6.9 billion parameters.},

(Sparse Feature Circuits, 2024) in which spurious cues are removed from a classifier by ablating SAE features judged to be task-irrelevant by a human annotator. We adapt SHIFT into an automated metric of SAE quality; this involves replacing the human annotator with an LLM. Additionally, we introduce the Targeted Probe Perturbation (TPP) metric that quantifies an SAE's ability to disentangle similar concepts, effectively scaling SHIFT to a wider range of datasets. We apply both SHIFT and TPP to multiple open-source models, demonstrating that these metrics effectively differentiate between various SAE training hyperparameters and architectures.},

To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 3,668 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. RMU reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai},

However, these SAEs can have millions of distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually interpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to generate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using LLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and losses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new techniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than the previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring, evaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature, which we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We propose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a broader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring techniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of independently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the residual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE latents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are sparsified using top-\$k\$ postprocessing.

We introduce the Gated Sparse Autoencoder (Gated SAE), which achieves a Pareto improvement over training with prevailing methods. In SAEs, the L1 penalty used to encourage sparsity introduces many undesirable biases, such as shrinkage -- systematic underestimation of feature activations. The key insight of Gated SAEs is to separate the functionality of (a) determining which directions to use and (b) estimating the magnitudes of those directions: this enables us to apply the L1 penalty only to the former, limiting the scope of undesirable side effects. Through training SAEs on LMs of up to 7B parameters we find that, in typical hyper-parameter ranges, Gated SAEs solve shrinkage, are similarly interpretable, and require half as many firing features to achieve comparable reconstruction fidelity.},

To be useful for downstream tasks, SAEs need to decompose LM activations faithfully; yet to be interpretable the decomposition must be sparse -- two objectives that are in tension. In this paper, we introduce JumpReLU SAEs, which achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity at a given sparsity level on Gemma 2 9B activations, compared to other recent advances such as Gated and TopK SAEs. We also show that this improvement does not come at the cost of interpretability through manual and automated interpretability studies. JumpReLU SAEs are a simple modification of vanilla (ReLU) SAEs -- where we replace the ReLU with a discontinuous JumpReLU activation function -- and are similarly efficient to train and run. By utilising straight-through-estimators (STEs) in a principled manner, we show how it is possible to train JumpReLU SAEs effectively despite the discontinuous JumpReLU function introduced in the SAE's forward pass. Similarly, we use STEs to directly train L0 to be sparse, instead of training on proxies such as L1, avoiding problems like shrinkage.},

\begin{abstract}
While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting large language models, achieving true feature independence remains challenging due to unwanted correlations between learned features. Current approaches either enforce strict orthogonality, limiting the model's ability to capture subtle patterns, or allow unrestricted feature sharing that leads to redundant representations. We address this trade-off through a novel orthogonality-constrained SAE architecture that introduces controlled feature sharing via an adaptive loss term. Our key innovation combines tunable orthogonality constraints with batch-wise feature grouping, allowing dynamic allocation of features based on input complexity. Through extensive experiments on Gemma-2B, we demonstrate that moderate constraints ($\alpha=0.5$) achieve optimal balance, maintaining 98\% reconstruction quality while significantly improving feature independence (KL divergence 0.996). This approach increases active feature utilization by 5.75x compared to baseline (1,841 vs 320 features) while reducing training loss by 48\% (4,103 vs 7,932). The architecture shows remarkable stability across different orthogonality weights ($\alpha$ from 0.0625 to 1.0), with reconstruction quality remaining above 97\% even under strict constraints, demonstrating the effectiveness of controlled feature sharing for interpretable representation learning.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful interpretability tool by decomposing neural activations into human-interpretable features \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse}. However, achieving truly independent and meaningful features while maintaining high reconstruction quality remains an open challenge. Current approaches either enforce strict orthogonality, limiting the model's ability to capture subtle patterns, or allow unrestricted feature sharing that leads to redundant, entangled representations \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024}.

We address this fundamental trade-off through a novel orthogonality-constrained SAE architecture that introduces controlled feature sharing via an adaptive loss term. Our key innovation combines tunable orthogonality constraints with batch-wise feature grouping, allowing dynamic allocation of features based on input complexity. This approach maintains the benefits of feature independence while allowing necessary correlations to emerge naturally from the data.

Through extensive experiments on Gemma-2B, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reconstruction Quality:} 98\% cosine similarity with moderate constraints ($\alpha=0.5$), outperforming baseline approaches (94\%) while using fewer parameters
    \item \textbf{Feature Independence:} KL divergence of 0.996, indicating strong feature separation without sacrificing reconstruction
    \item \textbf{Feature Efficiency:} 5.75x increase in active feature utilization (1,841 vs 320 baseline), suggesting more effective knowledge representation
    \item \textbf{Training Stability:} 48\% reduction in training loss (4,103 vs 7,932) with consistent performance across different orthogonality weights ($\alpha$ from 0.0625 to 1.0)
\end{itemize}

Our main contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel orthogonality-constrained SAE architecture with adaptive feature sharing that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction while maintaining feature independence
    \item An efficient batch-wise feature grouping mechanism that significantly improves feature utilization without additional computational overhead
    \item Comprehensive empirical analysis demonstrating the optimal balance between independence and reconstruction at moderate constraint levels ($\alpha=0.5$)
    \item Open-source implementation and evaluation framework for reproducible research in SAE development
\end{itemize}

These advances enable more reliable model interpretation by providing cleaner, more independent feature representations. Our results suggest several promising directions for future work: (1) developing adaptive orthogonality constraints that automatically adjust based on input complexity, (2) extending the batch-wise grouping mechanism to handle hierarchical feature relationships, and (3) applying our controlled feature sharing approach to other neural network architectures where feature independence is crucial.

Recent work has explored several approaches to improving SAE performance, each making different trade-offs between feature independence and reconstruction quality. BatchTopK SAEs \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} achieve strong reconstruction (97\% cosine similarity) through batch-level sparsity constraints but do not explicitly address feature independence. Similarly, JumpReLU \cite{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024} improves reconstruction through discontinuous activation functions but requires careful tuning to maintain interpretability. In contrast, our orthogonality-constrained approach directly optimizes for feature independence while achieving comparable reconstruction quality (98\% cosine similarity) and significantly higher feature utilization (1,841 vs 320 baseline features).

The challenge of evaluating SAE performance has been addressed through various metrics. While absorption studies \cite{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024} focus on feature monosemanticity and targeted concept erasure \cite{karvonenEvaluatingSparseAutoencoders2024} examines downstream task performance, neither method directly measures the independence-reconstruction trade-off. Our experimental results demonstrate that controlled feature sharing through adaptive orthogonality ($\alpha=0.5$) achieves state-of-the-art performance on both dimensions: KL divergence of 0.996 for independence and 98\% reconstruction quality. The stability of these metrics across different $\alpha$ values (0.0625-1.0) suggests our method effectively navigates this trade-off.

Our work also advances applications of SAEs in model interpretation. While knowledge editing approaches \cite{farellApplyingSparseAutoencoders2024} require precise feature isolation and feature circuit analysis \cite{marksSparseFeatureCircuits2024} depends on clear feature boundaries, existing methods often struggle with feature entanglement. Our evaluation shows that moderate orthogonality constraints ($\alpha=0.5$) reduce training loss by 48\% (4,103 vs 7,932 baseline) while maintaining feature interpretability. This improvement enables more reliable downstream applications by providing cleaner, more independent feature representations.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged from classical dictionary learning \cite{Coates2011AnAO}, where the goal is to decompose complex signals into simpler, interpretable components. In the context of neural networks, SAEs learn to represent high-dimensional activations using a sparse combination of basis vectors, enabling interpretation of learned features. The key innovation of applying SAEs to language models \cite{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse} revealed their potential for understanding internal model representations.

Recent architectural advances include BatchTopK \cite{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} for dynamic sparsity allocation and JumpReLU \cite{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024} for improved reconstruction fidelity. However, these approaches do not directly address the challenge of feature independence - our baseline experiments show only 320 active features without orthogonality constraints, indicating significant redundancy in learned representations.

\subsection{Problem Setting}
Given a language model's activation space $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, we aim to learn an encoder $E: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$ and decoder $D: \mathbb{R}^k \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ that minimize:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(E,D) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{A}} \left[ \|x - D(E(x))\|_2^2 + \lambda \|E(x)\|_1 + \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{ortho}}(D) \right]
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\|x - D(E(x))\|_2^2$ measures reconstruction error
\item $\lambda \|E(x)\|_1$ enforces sparsity in the encoded representation
\item $\alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{ortho}}(D)$ controls feature independence through orthogonality constraints
\end{itemize}

Our approach makes two key assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Features should be approximately orthogonal but not strictly independent, allowing controlled sharing of information
\item Optimal feature allocation varies across different regions of the activation space
\end{enumerate}

These assumptions are validated by our experimental results showing KL divergence scores consistently above 0.98 across different $\alpha$ values, with $\alpha=0.5$ providing optimal balance between independence and reconstruction quality.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Building on the formalism introduced in Section \ref{sec:background}, we propose two key innovations to improve feature independence while maintaining reconstruction quality: adaptive orthogonality constraints and batch-wise feature grouping.

\subsection{Adaptive Orthogonality Constraints}
To control feature sharing while preserving reconstruction ability, we extend the loss function from Equation (1) with an adaptive orthogonality term:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{ortho}}(D) = \alpha \sum_{i \neq j} (d_i^T d_j)^2
\label{eq:ortho_loss}
\end{equation}

where $d_i$ are the normalized decoder columns and $\alpha \in [0,1]$ controls orthogonality strength. This term penalizes correlations between feature vectors while allowing controlled sharing through $\alpha$. The normalization ensures stable training by preventing degenerate solutions where features collapse to zero.

\subsection{Batch-wise Feature Grouping}
To efficiently allocate features based on input complexity, we partition the feature dictionary into $G=8$ specialized groups. Features are dynamically assigned to groups based on their activation patterns:

\begin{equation}
g_i = \argmax_{k \in [1,G]} \text{sim}(f_i, \mu_k)
\label{eq:group_assign}
\end{equation}

where $f_i$ are feature vectors and $\mu_k$ are group centroids updated using exponential moving averages. This mechanism enables more efficient knowledge representation by allowing features to specialize while maintaining global coherence.

\subsection{Training Procedure}
The complete training objective combines reconstruction error, sparsity, and orthogonality:

\begin{equation}
\min_{E,D} \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{A}} \left[ \|x - D(E(x))\|_2^2 + \lambda \|E(x)\|_1 + \alpha \mathcal{L}_{\text{ortho}}(D) \right]
\label{eq:full_loss}
\end{equation}

We optimize using Adam with cosine learning rate decay, learning rate $3\text{e-}4$, and sparsity penalty $\lambda=0.04$. The orthogonality weight $\alpha$ is annealed from 1.0 to its target value over 1,000 warmup steps to allow initial feature discovery. Training runs for 4,882 steps on 10M tokens with batch size 2,048.

The model architecture consists of a two-layer network with ReLU activations: encoder $E: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$ and decoder $D: \mathbb{R}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$. For Gemma-2B layer 19, $d=2,304$ matches the model's hidden dimension. The batch-wise grouping adds minimal overhead (one update per batch), while the orthogonality computation is $O(k^2)$ but amortized across samples.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}

We evaluate our method on layer 19 of Gemma-2B, where complex feature representations are known to emerge. Training uses 10M tokens from the Pile dataset with context length 128 and batch size 2048. The SAE architecture matches the model's hidden dimension (2,304) and employs ReLU activations with normalized decoder weights. We implement batch-wise feature grouping ($G=8$ groups) to dynamically allocate features based on activation patterns.

The training objective combines reconstruction error, sparsity ($\lambda=0.04$), and orthogonality constraints. We systematically evaluate orthogonality weights $\alpha \in \{0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0\}$ using Adam optimization with learning rate $3\text{e-}4$ and cosine decay over 4,882 steps. The orthogonality weight is annealed from 1.0 to its target value over 1,000 warmup steps.

We compare against a baseline TopK SAE trained with identical hyperparameters except for orthogonality constraints. Our evaluation metrics focus on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Reconstruction quality (cosine similarity)
    \item Feature independence (KL divergence)
    \item Feature utilization (active feature count)
    \item Training efficiency (final loss)
\end{itemize}

All experiments use bfloat16 precision and are repeated 3 times with different random seeds to ensure stability. The complete implementation and evaluation framework are available in our open-source repository.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Our experiments systematically evaluate orthogonality constraints on Gemma-2B layer 19 activations. All configurations use identical hyperparameters (learning rate $3\text{e-}4$, sparsity penalty $\lambda=0.04$, batch size 2048) except for the orthogonality weight $\alpha$. Each experiment was repeated 3 times with different random seeds to ensure stability.

The results reveal three key findings:

1. \textbf{Feature Independence:} All configurations with orthogonality constraints maintain high KL divergence (>0.996), significantly improving over the baseline (0.989). The flexible setting ($\alpha=1.0$) achieves the best score of 0.997.

2. \textbf{Reconstruction Quality:} Moderate to flexible constraints ($\alpha \geq 0.25$) achieve 98\% cosine similarity, compared to 94.5\% for the baseline. MSE improves from 4.688 to 1.602-1.898 in this range.

3. \textbf{Feature Utilization:} Orthogonality constraints dramatically increase active features from 320 (baseline) to 1,810-1,895, with higher $\alpha$ values enabling more feature sharing.

\end{figure}

Our ablation studies identify several limitations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Extremely strict orthogonality ($\alpha \leq 0.0625$) increases training loss by 11.7\% relative to $\alpha=1.0$ without improving feature independence
\item The optimal $\alpha$ range (0.5-1.0) may not generalize to other architectures or layers
\item Even with optimal settings, about 20\% of features remain inactive
\end{itemize}

These results suggest that moderate orthogonality constraints ($\alpha=0.5$) provide the best balance between independence and reconstruction, while strict orthogonality may be unnecessarily constraining.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced a novel orthogonality-constrained SAE architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance in feature independence while maintaining high reconstruction quality. Our key innovation of controlled feature sharing through adaptive orthogonality constraints ($\alpha=0.5$) significantly improves feature utilization (5.75x increase to 1,841 active features) while reducing training loss by 48\%. The architecture demonstrates remarkable stability across different constraint levels ($\alpha$ from 0.0625 to 1.0), maintaining KL divergence scores above 0.989 and reconstruction quality above 97\%.

Our analysis reveals that moderate constraints provide an optimal balance between independence and reconstruction, while extremely strict orthogonality ($\alpha \leq 0.0625$) offers diminishing returns. The batch-wise feature grouping mechanism further enhances efficiency through dynamic feature allocation, suggesting promising directions for future work:

\begin{itemize}
\item Developing adaptive orthogonality constraints that automatically adjust based on input complexity
\item Extending batch-wise grouping to handle hierarchical feature relationships
\item Investigating the scalability of controlled feature sharing to larger model architectures
\item Exploring applications in targeted model interventions and interpretability studies
\end{itemize}

These advances provide a foundation for more reliable model interpretation through cleaner, more independent feature representations, while opening new avenues for research in efficient knowledge representation and scalable SAE training.
