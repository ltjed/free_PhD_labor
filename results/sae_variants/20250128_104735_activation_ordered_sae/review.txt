    "Summary": "The paper proposes HybridOrder, a feature organization technique for sparse autoencoders (SAEs) that combines fixed-interval reordering with adaptive scheduling based on activation statistics. This approach aims to improve the interpretability and stability of features in SAEs, as demonstrated on the Gemma-2B language model. The method achieves a 55% reduction in final training loss, strong model behavior preservation, and high reconstruction fidelity.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical problem in model interpretability and feature organization.",
        "Combines fixed-interval reordering with adaptive scheduling, which is a novel approach.",
        "Shows significant quantitative improvements in training stability and feature organization.",
        "Provides extensive experimental results and ablation studies."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "The methodology section lacks clarity and detailed explanations of the proposed techniques.",
        "Key technical innovations such as gradient accumulation, adaptive L1 penalty scaling, and unit-norm constraints are not sufficiently detailed.",
        "The impact of different design choices is not thoroughly analyzed.",
        "The paper could benefit from additional ablation studies and comparisons with other methods.",
        "The structure and presentation of the paper need improvement for better readability and understanding.",
        "The practical utility and broader impact of the proposed technique are not convincingly demonstrated.",
        "Some claims made in the paper appear overstated based on the provided evidence."
