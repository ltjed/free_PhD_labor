    "Summary": "The paper introduces a novel method for improving the interpretability of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) by addressing feature absorption through selective orthogonality constraints. The method dynamically enforces orthogonality constraints between decoder weights based on their semantic similarity, allowing for natural feature discovery and maintaining strong reconstruction quality. The paper provides extensive experiments demonstrating significant improvements in sparsity and feature separation while maintaining acceptable trade-offs in model behavior preservation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The proposed selective orthogonality constraint is a novel approach to addressing feature absorption in SAEs, which is a critical issue for interpretability.",
        "Extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2B dataset show significant improvements in sparsity, reconstruction quality, and feature separation.",
        "The paper provides a detailed analysis of trade-offs between interpretability metrics and model behavior preservation, which is important for practical applications."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The description of the autoencoder aggregator is not clear, making it difficult to fully understand the implementation and its impact.",
        "Baseline comparisons are limited. Including more diverse baselines would strengthen the evaluation of the proposed method.",
        "The paper lacks detailed explanations in some sections, which affects the overall clarity and understanding of the methodology.",
        "Insufficient ablation studies to explore the impact of different components and hyperparameters of the proposed method.",
        "Limited discussion on the potential limitations and societal impacts of the proposed approach.",
        "Qualitative analyses are limited; more cases and visualizations would strengthen the evaluation."
