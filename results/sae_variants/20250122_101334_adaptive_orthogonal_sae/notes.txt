## Run 0: Baseline
Results: {'eval_type_id': 'sparse_probing', ...}
Description: Baseline results.

## Run 1: Adaptive Orthogonality Loss (α=0.1)
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04, 'eval_type_id': 'unlearning', ...}
Description: Implemented adaptive orthogonality loss with α=0.1. Key changes:
- Added orthogonality constraint to loss function: L_ortho = α * ||W_dec^T W_dec - I||_F^2
- Initial α value set to 0.1 for controlled feature sharing
- Evaluated on unlearning task using WMDP-bio dataset
- Results show unlearning_score=0.0, indicating the initial implementation needs tuning
- Analysis suggests the orthogonality constraint may be too weak at α=0.1

## Run 2: Adaptive Orthogonality Loss (α=0.3)
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04, 'eval_type_id': 'unlearning', 'eval_result_metrics': {'unlearning': {'unlearning_score': 0.0}}}
Description: Increased orthogonality constraint strength to α=0.3 to test stronger feature separation. Key observations:
- Despite stronger constraint, unlearning_score remains 0.0
- Suggests that pure orthogonality constraint alone may not be sufficient for effective knowledge separation
- Need to implement batch-wise feature grouping with periodic updates as planned next step
- Current hypothesis: Need dynamic feature grouping to better separate knowledge subspaces

## Run 3: Dynamic Feature Grouping with Orthogonality (α=0.3)
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04, 'eval_type_id': 'unlearning', 'eval_result_metrics': {'unlearning': {'unlearning_score': 0.0}}}
Description: Implemented dynamic feature grouping with periodic updates every 1000 steps, maintaining orthogonality constraint (α=0.3). Key changes:
- Added feature grouping based on cosine similarity between decoder weights
- Grouping threshold set to 0.7 for creating distinct feature subspaces
- Groups updated every 1000 training steps to adapt to changing feature representations
- Maintained orthogonality constraint with α=0.3 to prevent feature overlap
Key observations:
- Unlearning score remains 0.0 despite dynamic feature grouping
- Suggests that feature grouping alone may not be sufficient for knowledge separation
- Possible explanations:
  1. Grouping threshold may be too permissive (0.7)
  2. Feature subspaces may still overlap despite grouping
  3. Need stronger constraints on feature activation patterns

## Run 4: Adaptive Feature Grouping with Activation Statistics (α=0.3)
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04, 'eval_type_id': 'unlearning', 'eval_result_metrics': {'unlearning': {'unlearning_score': 0.0}}}
Description: Implemented adaptive feature grouping with activation-based thresholds, maintaining orthogonality constraint (α=0.3). Key changes:

- Implemented adaptive grouping thresholds based on activation patterns
  - More active features have tighter grouping thresholds (0.6-0.9 range)
  - Thresholds adjusted dynamically based on activation consistency
- Maintained orthogonality constraint with α=0.3
- Groups updated every 1000 training steps with adaptive thresholds
Key observations:
- Unlearning score remains 0.0 despite adaptive grouping
- Suggests that feature grouping based on decoder weights alone may not be sufficient
- Possible explanations:
  1. Feature activations may not correlate well with knowledge separation
  2. Need to consider both encoder and decoder weights for grouping
  3. May need to incorporate task-specific information for grouping
## Run 5: Cross-Feature Inhibition with Adaptive Orthogonality (α=0.3)
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04, 'eval_type_id': 'unlearning', 'eval_result_metrics': {'unlearning': {'unlearning_score': 0.0}}}
Description: Implemented cross-feature inhibition to penalize simultaneous feature activations. Key changes:
- Added inhibition loss term: L_inhib = 0.1 * mean(square(corr(features)))
- Inhibition only applied after warmup period (1000 steps)
- Maintained adaptive orthogonality constraint (α=0.3)
- Used upper triangular mask to avoid redundant penalty terms
Key observations:
- Unlearning score remains 0.0 despite inhibition mechanism
- Suggests that feature activation patterns alone may not be sufficient for knowledge separation
- Possible explanations:
  1. Inhibition strength (0.1) may be too weak
  2. Feature correlations may not capture task-specific knowledge separation
  3. Need to incorporate task-specific information into inhibition mechanism

## Run 6: Feature Importance Weighting with Dynamic Inhibition (α=0.3)
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04, 'eval_type_id': 'unlearning', 'eval_result_metrics': {'unlearning': {'unlearning_score': 0.0}}}

- Added feature sensitivity tracking (L2 norm of decoder weights)
- Implemented importance-weighted inhibition loss
- Added dynamic inhibition strength based on average feature activation
- Maintained adaptive orthogonality constraint (α=0.3)
Key observations:
- Unlearning score remains 0.0 despite importance weighting
- Suggests that feature importance alone may not be sufficient for knowledge separation
- Possible explanations:
  1. Feature importance may not correlate with knowledge separation
  2. Need task-specific feature importance measures
  3. May need to incorporate task-specific information into feature grouping

## Run 7: Task-Specific Feature Grouping with Category-Based Inhibition (α=0.3)
Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04, 'eval_type_id': 'unlearning', 'eval_result_metrics': {'unlearning': {'unlearning_score': 0.0}}}
