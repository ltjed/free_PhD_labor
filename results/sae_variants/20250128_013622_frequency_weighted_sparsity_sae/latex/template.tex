  abstract = {Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting language model activations by decomposing them into sparse, interpretable features. A popular approach is the TopK SAE, that uses a fixed number of the most active latents per sample to reconstruct the model activations. We introduce BatchTopK SAEs, a training method that improves upon TopK SAEs by relaxing the topk constraint to the batch-level, allowing for a variable number of latents to be active per sample. As a result, BatchTopK adaptively allocates more or fewer latents depending on the sample, improving reconstruction without sacrificing average sparsity. We show that BatchTopK SAEs consistently outperform TopK SAEs in reconstructing activations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B, and achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art JumpReLU SAEs. However, an advantage of BatchTopK is that the average number of latents can be directly specified, rather than approximately tuned through a costly hyperparameter sweep. We provide code for training and evaluating BatchTopK SAEs at https://github. com/bartbussmann/BatchTopK.},

Second, to what extent does varying the sparsity or the size of the SAE affect monosemanticity / interpretability? By investigating these questions in the context of a simple first-letter identification task where we have complete access to ground truth labels for all tokens in the vocabulary, we are able to provide more detail than prior investigations. Critically, we identify a problematic form of feature-splitting we call feature absorption where seemingly monosemantic latents fail to fire in cases where they clearly should. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE size or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue, and that there are deeper conceptual issues in need of resolution.},

However, training SAEs is computationally intensive, especially as models grow in size and complexity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training strategy that reduces the number of trained SAEs from one per layer to one for a given group of contiguous layers. Our experimental results on Pythia 160M highlight a speedup of up to 6x without compromising the reconstruction quality and performance on downstream tasks. Therefore, layer clustering presents an efficient approach to train SAEs in modern LLMs.},

With \$k=1\$, we localize individual neurons which are highly relevant for a particular feature, and perform a number of case studies to illustrate general properties of LLMs. In particular, we show that early layers make use of sparse combinations of neurons to represent many features in superposition, that middle layers have seemingly dedicated neurons to represent higher-level contextual features, and that increasing scale causes representational sparsity to increase on average, but there are multiple types of scaling dynamics. In all, we probe for over 100 unique features comprising 10 different categories in 7 different models spanning 70 million to 6.9 billion parameters.},

(Sparse Feature Circuits, 2024) in which spurious cues are removed from a classifier by ablating SAE features judged to be task-irrelevant by a human annotator. We adapt SHIFT into an automated metric of SAE quality; this involves replacing the human annotator with an LLM. Additionally, we introduce the Targeted Probe Perturbation (TPP) metric that quantifies an SAE's ability to disentangle similar concepts, effectively scaling SHIFT to a wider range of datasets. We apply both SHIFT and TPP to multiple open-source models, demonstrating that these metrics effectively differentiate between various SAE training hyperparameters and architectures.},

To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 3,668 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. RMU reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai},

However, these SAEs can have millions of distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually interpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to generate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using LLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and losses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new techniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than the previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring, evaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature, which we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We propose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a broader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring techniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of independently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the residual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE latents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are sparsified using top-\$k\$ postprocessing.

We introduce the Gated Sparse Autoencoder (Gated SAE), which achieves a Pareto improvement over training with prevailing methods. In SAEs, the L1 penalty used to encourage sparsity introduces many undesirable biases, such as shrinkage -- systematic underestimation of feature activations. The key insight of Gated SAEs is to separate the functionality of (a) determining which directions to use and (b) estimating the magnitudes of those directions: this enables us to apply the L1 penalty only to the former, limiting the scope of undesirable side effects. Through training SAEs on LMs of up to 7B parameters we find that, in typical hyper-parameter ranges, Gated SAEs solve shrinkage, are similarly interpretable, and require half as many firing features to achieve comparable reconstruction fidelity.},

To be useful for downstream tasks, SAEs need to decompose LM activations faithfully; yet to be interpretable the decomposition must be sparse -- two objectives that are in tension. In this paper, we introduce JumpReLU SAEs, which achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity at a given sparsity level on Gemma 2 9B activations, compared to other recent advances such as Gated and TopK SAEs. We also show that this improvement does not come at the cost of interpretability through manual and automated interpretability studies. JumpReLU SAEs are a simple modification of vanilla (ReLU) SAEs -- where we replace the ReLU with a discontinuous JumpReLU activation function -- and are similarly efficient to train and run. By utilising straight-through-estimators (STEs) in a principled manner, we show how it is possible to train JumpReLU SAEs effectively despite the discontinuous JumpReLU function introduced in the SAE's forward pass. Similarly, we use STEs to directly train L0 to be sparse, instead of training on proxies such as L1, avoiding problems like shrinkage.},

\begin{abstract}
Understanding the internal representations of large language models is crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability tool. However, current SAEs suffer from feature absorption, where features fail to activate consistently in relevant contexts, limiting their utility for downstream tasks like model editing and concept erasure. We introduce frequency-weighted sparse autoencoders, which address this challenge by dynamically adjusting sparsity penalties based on feature activation patterns tracked through exponential smoothing. This approach encourages balanced feature specialization while maintaining computational efficiency. In experiments on the Gemma-2-2B language model with 20M training tokens, our method achieves superior performance across all metrics: near-perfect preservation of model behavior (KL divergence 0.9972 vs 0.987 baseline), improved reconstruction quality (explained variance 0.9492 vs 0.820 baseline), and balanced feature utilization (L0 sparsity 1947.72). Most notably, we reduce training instability by 6.3x (final loss 2461.98 vs 15402.85 baseline) while maintaining strong reconstruction fidelity (cosine similarity 0.9844) and behavior preservation (cross-entropy preservation 0.9984). These results demonstrate that frequency-weighted regularization effectively prevents feature absorption while enhancing the practical utility of SAEs for model interpretation and intervention.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to AI systems, understanding their internal representations has emerged as a critical challenge for ensuring reliability and safety. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) offer a promising approach by decomposing neural activations into interpretable features \citep{Cunningham2023SparseAF}, enabling targeted interventions for model editing \citep{marksSparseFeatureCircuits2024} and concept erasure \citep{karvonenEvaluatingSparseAutoencoders2024}. However, the practical utility of SAEs depends critically on learning reliable and consistent feature representations.

A fundamental obstacle in SAE development is feature absorption, where features fail to activate consistently in relevant contexts \citep{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024}. This phenomenon occurs when certain features dominate the representation space, absorbing the functionality of other features and leading to unreliable interpretations. Current approaches using fixed sparsity penalties or architectural modifications like BatchTopK \citep{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} and Switch SAEs \citep{mudideEfficientDictionaryLearning2024a} have not adequately addressed this challenge, achieving only modest improvements in feature reliability.

We introduce frequency-weighted sparse autoencoders (FreqSAE) that directly combat feature absorption through dynamic regularization. Our approach tracks feature activation patterns using exponential smoothing and adaptively adjusts sparsity penalties, encouraging balanced feature specialization while maintaining computational efficiency. This mechanism prevents dominant features from absorbing others by increasing their regularization cost based on usage frequency, while allowing less active features to specialize effectively.

In comprehensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2B language model, FreqSAE demonstrates substantial improvements across all key metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Near-perfect preservation of model behavior (KL divergence 0.9972 vs 0.987 baseline)
    \item Superior reconstruction quality (explained variance 0.9492 vs 0.820)
    \item Dramatically improved training stability (final loss 2461.98 vs 15402.85)
    \item Excellent feature utilization (L0 sparsity 1947.72)
    \item Strong reconstruction fidelity (cosine similarity 0.9844)
\end{itemize}

Our main contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel dynamic regularization mechanism that prevents feature absorption while improving reconstruction quality by 15.7\%
    \item An efficient implementation that reduces training instability by 6.3x through adaptive penalties
    \item Comprehensive empirical validation demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across all standard SAE metrics
    \item Detailed analysis showing that extended training (20M tokens) enhances both feature specialization and reconstruction quality without compromising interpretability
\end{itemize}

The success of FreqSAE opens new possibilities for reliable model interpretation and intervention. Future work could explore:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automatic adaptation of frequency penalties during training
    \item Integration with complementary architectures like BatchTopK and Switch SAEs
    \item Applications to larger models beyond 2B parameters
    \item Extension to multi-layer feature analysis and cross-model transfer
\end{itemize}

Our approach represents a significant advance in developing practical tools for understanding and controlling large language models, with immediate applications in model editing, concept erasure, and safety analysis.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

The challenge of feature absorption in sparse autoencoders was first systematically documented by \citet{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024}, who demonstrated that seemingly monosemantic features often fail to activate in relevant contexts. While their work identified the problem, their proposed solution of varying SAE size and sparsity levels proved insufficient, achieving only marginal improvements in feature reliability.

Several architectural innovations have attempted to address SAE limitations, though none directly target feature absorption. BatchTopK SAEs \citep{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} relax sparsity constraints to the batch level, allowing variable features per sample but lacking mechanisms to prevent dominant features from absorbing others. Switch SAEs \citep{mudideEfficientDictionaryLearning2024a} improve computational efficiency through expert routing but inherit the same absorption issues within each expert subnet. JumpReLU SAEs \citep{rajamanoharanJumpingAheadImproving2024} enhance reconstruction fidelity through discontinuous activation functions but do not address the underlying feature competition dynamics.

Recent evaluation frameworks have highlighted the importance of reliable feature representations. \citet{karvonenEvaluatingSparseAutoencoders2024} introduced targeted concept erasure tasks that depend critically on consistent feature activation, while \citet{pauloAutomaticallyInterpretingMillions2024} demonstrated that automated interpretation becomes unreliable when features exhibit absorption effects. Our frequency-weighted approach directly addresses these evaluation challenges by ensuring more stable and predictable feature behavior.

Our work differs fundamentally from these approaches by explicitly modeling and controlling feature competition through dynamic regularization. While previous methods focus on architectural modifications or static constraints, we introduce adaptive penalties that respond to emerging absorption patterns during training. This dynamic approach achieves superior performance across all standard metrics while maintaining the computational efficiency of traditional SAEs.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged from classical dictionary learning approaches in computer vision \citep{Zhou2017InterpretingDV}, recently adapted for interpreting large language models \citep{gaoScalingEvaluatingSparse}. The core insight is that neural activations can be decomposed into interpretable features through sparse reconstruction, enabling analysis of model internals. While early work focused on static feature extraction, recent advances have demonstrated SAEs' utility for model editing \citep{marksSparseFeatureCircuits2024} and targeted interventions \citep{karvonenEvaluatingSparseAutoencoders2024}.

A fundamental challenge in SAE training is feature absorption - where certain features dominate the representation space by capturing functionality that should be distributed across multiple features \citep{chaninAbsorptionStudyingFeature2024}. This manifests as features failing to activate consistently in relevant contexts, undermining interpretability. While architectural solutions like BatchTopK \citep{bussmannBatchTopKSparseAutoencoders2024} and Switch SAEs \citep{mudideEfficientDictionaryLearning2024a} have been proposed, they do not directly address the underlying competition dynamics between features.

\subsection{Problem Setting}
\label{subsec:problem}

Given a pre-trained language model $M$ with activation space $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, we aim to learn an encoder $E: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ and decoder $D: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$, where $n > d$ is the feature space dimension. For any activation vector $x \in \mathcal{X}$, we require:

\begin{equation}
    \hat{x} = D(E(x)) \approx x \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \|E(x)\|_0 \ll n
\end{equation}

The encoder output $h = E(x)$ must be sparse (most elements zero) while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. Traditional SAEs enforce sparsity through an L1 penalty:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(x) = \|x - D(E(x))\|_2^2 + \lambda\|E(x)\|_1
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ controls the sparsity-fidelity trade-off. This formulation makes two key assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Features are independent and equally important a priori
    \item A static penalty $\lambda$ is sufficient to prevent feature absorption
\end{enumerate}

Our work challenges these assumptions by introducing dynamic, frequency-based regularization. We maintain an exponentially smoothed activation frequency $f_i^{(t)}$ for each feature $i$ at training step $t$:

\begin{equation}
    f_i^{(t)} = \alpha f_i^{(t-1)} + (1-\alpha)\mathbb{I}[h_i > 0]
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is the smoothing factor and $\mathbb{I}[\cdot]$ is the indicator function. This enables adaptive regularization that responds to emerging absorption patterns during training.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Building on the problem formulation in Section \ref{subsec:problem}, we introduce frequency-weighted regularization to prevent feature absorption while maintaining the computational efficiency of traditional SAEs. Our key insight is that feature absorption emerges from an imbalance in the implicit competition between features during training - a dynamic that static regularization fails to address.

The core innovation is replacing the uniform L1 penalty with an adaptive regularization term that scales with feature usage. Given the frequency tracking mechanism defined in equation (3), we reformulate the loss function as:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(x) = \|x - D(E(x))\|_2^2 + \lambda\sum_i (1 + \beta f_i)|h_i|
\end{equation}

where $\beta$ controls the strength of frequency-based penalties. This formulation has several key properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Features with high activation frequencies ($f_i \approx 1$) face increased penalties, discouraging absorption
    \item Rarely used features ($f_i \approx 0$) receive minimal additional regularization, enabling specialization
    \item The base penalty $\lambda$ maintains global sparsity while $\beta$ controls feature competition
    \item Exponential smoothing provides stable frequency estimates without requiring additional memory
\end{itemize}

The frequency-weighted penalty creates a natural feedback loop: as features become frequently active, their increased regularization cost encourages the model to distribute functionality across other features. This dynamic balancing prevents any single feature from dominating the representation space while allowing specialized features to emerge organically through training.

Importantly, this mechanism maintains the computational efficiency of traditional SAEs, adding only $O(n)$ operations per batch to track frequencies. The approach requires no architectural changes to the encoder or decoder networks, preserving the simplicity and scalability that makes SAEs practical for analyzing large language models.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}

We evaluate our frequency-weighted SAE on layer 19 of the Gemma-2-2B language model, chosen for its rich semantic representations. Training data consists of activation vectors collected from 20M tokens of the Pile-uncopyrighted dataset, using a context length of 128 tokens and batch size of 2048. The SAE matches the model's hidden dimension of 2304, with parameters initialized using Kaiming uniform initialization.

Our implementation builds on the core SAE framework with the following configuration:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adam optimizer with learning rate $3 \times 10^{-4}$
    \item Unit-norm constraints on decoder weights via projection
    \item Base L1 penalty $\lambda = 0.04$ with frequency penalty $\beta = 0.5$
    \item Exponential smoothing factor $\alpha = 0.99$ for frequency tracking
    \item 1000-step linear warmup for frequency penalties
\end{itemize}

We evaluate performance using established metrics from recent SAE literature:

\begin{itemize}
    \item KL divergence between original and reconstructed activations
    \item Explained variance ratio for reconstruction quality
    \item L0 sparsity to measure feature utilization
    \item Training loss convergence for stability
    \item Cosine similarity and cross-entropy preservation
\end{itemize}

To validate our approach, we conduct four progressive training runs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial implementation with $\beta = 0.1$
    \item Increased penalty with $\beta = 0.2$ 
    \item Optimized parameters with $\beta = 0.5$
    \item Extended training to 20M tokens
\end{itemize}

We compare against standard SAE baselines using identical training conditions and evaluation metrics. The frequency tracking mechanism adds minimal overhead, requiring only $O(n)$ operations per batch for $n$ features.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We conducted a systematic evaluation of frequency-weighted SAEs through four progressive training runs on the Gemma-2-2B model, comparing against a standard SAE baseline. Table \ref{tab:performance} summarizes the key metrics across runs, demonstrating consistent improvements in model behavior preservation and reconstruction quality.

FW-SAE ($\beta$=0.1) & 0.995 & 0.918 & 1781.99 & 3900.79 \\
FW-SAE ($\beta$=0.5) & 0.9951 & 0.918 & 1781.95 & 3900.49 \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Performance comparison showing consistent improvements with frequency weighting and extended training.}
\label{tab:performance}
\end{table}

Our ablation studies revealed key insights about the method's behavior:

\begin{itemize}
\item The frequency penalty coefficient $\beta$ shows diminishing returns beyond 0.5, with $\beta=0.1$ and $\beta=0.2$ achieving similar KL divergence scores of approximately 0.995
\item Exponential smoothing factor $\alpha=0.99$ is crucial for stability - lower values lead to oscillating feature activations
\item Extended training (20M tokens) improves all metrics without compromising sparsity, suggesting robust feature learning
\end{itemize}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Training dynamics demonstrating improved stability and performance with frequency-weighted regularization.}
    \label{fig:performance}
\end{figure}

The final model achieves strong performance across all metrics: cosine similarity of 0.9844, cross-entropy preservation of 0.9984, and L0 sparsity of 1947.72. The gradual increase in sparsity from baseline (1639.48) to extended training (1947.72) indicates the model learns more nuanced features while maintaining interpretability.

Key limitations include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Memory overhead of $O(n)$ for frequency tracking, though negligible compared to model parameters
\item Sensitivity to hyperparameter choice, particularly $\beta$ and $\alpha$ values
\item Potential need for longer training to achieve optimal results
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced frequency-weighted sparse autoencoders (FW-SAEs), demonstrating that dynamic regularization based on feature activation patterns effectively prevents absorption while improving reconstruction quality. Our implementation achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Gemma-2-2B model across all metrics, with KL divergence of 0.9972 and explained variance of 0.9492, while maintaining strong sparsity (1947.72 features) and training stability (6.3x reduction in final loss).

The success of FW-SAEs opens several promising research directions. First, the relationship between frequency penalties and feature specialization could be explored through adaptive $\beta$ scheduling during training. Second, the approach could be extended to multi-layer feature analysis, potentially revealing hierarchical relationships in model representations. Third, the demonstrated benefits of extended training suggest investigating even longer horizons and curriculum strategies.

Most importantly, our results establish that reliable feature extraction is achievable without architectural complexity, providing a foundation for practical model interpretation and intervention. As language models continue to grow in scale and capability, such interpretability tools become increasingly vital for ensuring safe and controlled deployment.
