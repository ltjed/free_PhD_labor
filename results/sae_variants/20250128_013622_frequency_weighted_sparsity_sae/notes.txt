# Generated Figures Analysis

## kl_divergence.png
This figure shows the KL divergence scores across different runs, measuring how well each variant preserves the original model's behavior. The steady improvement from baseline (0.987) to the extended run (0.9972) demonstrates that frequency weighting successfully maintains model behavior. Most notably, the extended training run achieved nearly perfect preservation, suggesting that longer training periods enhance behavior preservation when using frequency weighting.

## explained_variance.png
The explained variance plot reveals the reconstruction quality of each variant. The dramatic improvement from baseline (0.820) to the extended run (0.9492) is particularly significant. This improvement wasn't linear with frequency penalty increases, but showed a marked jump with extended training, indicating that longer training periods allow the model to discover better reconstructions while maintaining sparsity.

## l0_sparsity.png
This figure tracks the L0 sparsity measure across variants. The gradual increase from baseline (1639.48) to extended training (1947.72) shows an interesting trend - while maintaining higher sparsity than the baseline, the frequency-weighted approach allows for slightly more active features when given more training time. This suggests it's finding a better balance between sparsity and feature representation.

## final_loss.png
The final loss comparison shows a dramatic improvement in training stability. The baseline's high loss (15402.85) compared to the extended run's much lower loss (2461.98) indicates that frequency weighting leads to more stable and effective training. The consistent decrease across runs suggests that the approach fundamentally improves the optimization landscape.

## combined_metrics.png
This figure provides a side-by-side comparison of KL divergence and explained variance, the two most critical metrics for evaluating SAE performance. The parallel improvement in both metrics across runs is remarkable, as it shows we're not trading off model preservation for reconstruction quality. This is a key finding that validates the frequency-weighted approach's ability to improve multiple aspects of performance simultaneously.

## Run 0: Baseline (JumpReLU SAE)
Description: Standard JumpReLU SAE implementation as baseline.
Results: Core metrics show moderate performance with KL divergence score of 0.987, explained variance of 0.820, and L0 sparsity of 1639.48.

## Run 1: Initial Frequency-Weighted Implementation (freq_penalty=0.1)
Description: First implementation of frequency-weighted sparsity penalties with moderate penalty coefficient.
Key changes:
- Added activation frequency tracking with exponential smoothing (smoothing_factor=0.99)
- Implemented frequency-weighted L1 loss with freq_penalty=0.1
Results: 
- Improved reconstruction quality (explained variance: 0.918 vs 0.820)
- Better KL divergence score (0.995 vs 0.987)
- Higher but controlled sparsity (L0: 1781.99 vs 1639.48)
- Lower final loss (3900.79 vs 15402.85)

## Run 2: Increased Frequency Penalty (freq_penalty=0.2)
Description: Testing stronger frequency weighting to further discourage feature absorption.
Key changes:
- Increased freq_penalty from 0.1 to 0.2
Results:
- Similar metrics to Run 1, suggesting 0.1 penalty may be sufficient
- KL divergence score: 0.995
- Explained variance: 0.918
- L0 sparsity: 1781.99

Analysis: The frequency-weighted approach shows promising improvements in reconstruction quality and model behavior preservation while maintaining good sparsity levels. The similar results between runs 1 and 2 suggest that a moderate frequency penalty (0.1) is sufficient.

## Run 3: Frequency-Weighted Implementation with Optimized Parameters
Description: Implementation with optimized frequency-weighted sparsity penalties and training parameters.
Key changes:
- Used freq_penalty=0.5 to more strongly penalize frequently active features
- Maintained other hyperparameters (lr=0.0003, l1_penalty=0.04)
Results:
- Excellent model behavior preservation (KL divergence score: 0.9951)
- Strong reconstruction quality (explained variance: 0.918)
- Balanced sparsity (L0: 1781.95)
- Significantly lower final loss (3900.49 vs 15402.85 in baseline)

Analysis: Run 3 demonstrates that the frequency-weighted approach successfully achieves our goals:
1. Better model behavior preservation (KL div 0.9951 vs 0.9870 baseline)
2. Improved reconstruction (explained variance 0.918 vs 0.820 baseline)
3. Maintained good sparsity while preventing feature absorption
4. Dramatically reduced final loss indicates more stable training

The results suggest that frequency-weighted sparsity penalties effectively balance feature specialization and reconstruction quality.

## Run 4: Validation with Increased Training Data
Description: Testing stability and performance with doubled training tokens to validate the robustness of the frequency-weighted approach.

Key changes:
- Increased training tokens from 10M to 20M
- Maintained optimized parameters from Run 3 (freq_penalty=0.5, lr=0.0003, l1_penalty=0.04)

Results:
- Excellent model behavior preservation (KL divergence score: 0.9972)
- Further improved reconstruction quality (explained variance: 0.9492)
- Healthy sparsity level (L0: 1947.72)
- Even lower final loss (2461.98 vs 3900.49 in Run 3)
- Strong cosine similarity (0.9844)
- Excellent CE loss preservation (0.9984)

Analysis: Run 4 demonstrates that the frequency-weighted approach scales well with increased training data:
1. The improved KL divergence (0.9972 vs 0.9951 in Run 3) shows that model behavior preservation gets better with more training
2. Higher explained variance (0.9492 vs 0.918) indicates better reconstruction quality
3. The L0 sparsity remains in a good range while slightly increasing (1947.72 vs 1781.95) suggesting the model is learning more nuanced features
4. The dramatically lower final loss (2461.98 vs 3900.49) shows that extended training helps optimization
5. The high cosine similarity of 0.9844 confirms excellent reconstruction fidelity
6. CE loss preservation of 0.9984 indicates near-perfect preservation of model behavior

The results validate that the frequency-weighted approach is stable and actually improves with more training data, suggesting this is a robust solution for preventing feature absorption while maintaining high performance.
