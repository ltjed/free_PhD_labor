    "Summary": "The paper investigates the challenge of temporal disentanglement in transformer-based language models using position-aware sparse autoencoders. The authors propose a hierarchical architecture that separates global and position-specific features through learned gating mechanisms, position-dependent loss scaling, and attention-based feature routing. Despite stable training and reasonable reconstruction performance, the experiments reveal an inability to achieve meaningful temporal disentanglement, with global features consistently dominating the learned representations.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses a significant and challenging problem in the field of language models.",
        "The hierarchical architecture and systematic experimentation provide comprehensive insights.",
        "The negative results are valuable as they challenge existing assumptions about feature separability."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The primary objective of achieving temporal disentanglement is not met.",
        "The architectural complexity did not translate into meaningful improvements in temporal disentanglement.",
        "The paper could benefit from more detailed explanations, particularly regarding the implementation and ablation studies.",
        "The practical impact is limited due to the negative results."

        "Can the authors provide more detailed explanations of the implementation, particularly the autoencoder aggregator and the hierarchical feature extraction?",
        "What are the potential reasons for the failure to achieve temporal disentanglement, and how might future work address these challenges?",
        "Could alternative loss formulations or inductive biases help in achieving better results?",
        "Are there other metrics that could better capture the effectiveness of temporal disentanglement?",
        "Could the authors clarify the mathematical formulations and better integrate them into the text?",
        "Can the authors provide more detailed analysis on why the proposed methods failed to achieve temporal disentanglement?",
        "Are there any alternative approaches or modifications that might address the identified limitations?"

    "Limitations": [
        "The authors should discuss the limitations of their approach in more detail and suggest directions for future research to overcome these fundamental challenges.",
        "The proposed architectures are unable to induce meaningful position-specific feature specialization, raising questions about the core methodology.",
        "The paper should discuss more about the fundamental limitations of the approach and why temporal disentanglement might be inherently challenging.",
        "The paper acknowledges the limitations of the proposed methods in achieving temporal disentanglement. The authors should explore alternative approaches or modifications to address these limitations."
