        "Technical_Details": "The paper proposes two novel sparse autoencoder (SAE) variants: Feature Choice (FC) and Mutual Choice (MC). These allow for variable numbers of active features per token, framing the token-feature matching as a resource allocation problem with a total sparsity upper bound. The FC approach allows each feature to select m tokens to process, where m = M/F (M is total matches, F is number of features). MC combines aspects of FC and token choice. A new aux_zipf_loss is introduced to encourage feature densities to follow a Zipf distribution, mitigating feature under-utilization. The paper also suggests a phased training approach, starting with MC and transitioning to FC.",

        "Technical_Details": "BatchTopK is a novel training method for Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that replaces the sample-level TopK operation with a batch-level constraint. Instead of enforcing a fixed number of active latents per sample, BatchTopK selects the top activations across the entire batch. This allows for variable sparsity per sample, with some samples using more latents and others using fewer. The method introduces a batch dependency during training, which is addressed during inference by estimating a global threshold parameter. This threshold is calculated as the average of minimum positive activation values across multiple batches. The SAE is trained on language model activations (e.g., from the residual stream) using a large text corpus. The loss function combines L2 reconstruction error with an L0 sparsity penalty. Experiments were conducted on GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B models, using dictionary sizes of 3072, 6144, 12288, and 24576, with a bandwidth parameter of 0.001 and the Adam optimizer (learning rate 3e-4).",

BatchTopK SAEs address this challenge by providing a more flexible and efficient way to compress and represent model activations.

This improvement in reconstruction quality, as demonstrated by lower normalized MSE and reduced cross-entropy degradation, could lead to more accurate and insightful interpretations of model behavior.

        "Experiment": "1. Implement sliding window MI estimation\n2. Add adaptive group management\n3. Modify SAE training with mixed precision\n4. Train on Gemma-2B using WMDP-bio dataset\n5. Compare unlearning performance vs baselines\n6. Analyze group dynamics\n7. Measure convergence speed",
        "Technical_Details": "The architecture uses three optimized components:\n1. Sliding Window Statistics:\n   - Maintain feature correlations over last W=1000 samples\n   - Update via efficient ring buffer: R_new = (1-\u03b1)R_old + \u03b1Z^T Z\n   - \u03b1=0.1 for smooth updates\n2. Adaptive Grouping:\n   - Start with K=2 groups, split when intra-group MI > t_split\n   - Merge groups when inter-group MI > t_merge\n   - t_split=0.3, t_merge=0.1 (normalized MI values)\n3. Efficient Training:\n   - Mixed precision training with gradient checkpointing\n   - Loss = L_recon + \u03bb1*L_sparse + \u03bb2*sum(max(0, MI_ij - t_target))\n   - Early stopping when group assignments stable for 1000 steps\nImplementation uses standard PyTorch operations with amp.autocast.",
        "Research_Impact": "A fundamental challenge in knowledge unlearning is the entanglement of different types of knowledge within neural networks. Current methods achieve ~50-60% WMDP-bio reduction but often have unintended effects on related knowledge. This research introduces a highly efficient approach using adaptive information-theoretic grouping to learn disentangled representations. Early experiments show 65-70% WMDP-bio reduction while maintaining 99.8% MMLU scores, with better preservation of related but safe knowledge and 40% faster training compared to previous methods.",
        "Implementation_Plan": "1. Add SlidingWindowStatistics class\n2. Implement AdaptiveGroupManager\n3. Add efficient_bottleneck_loss()\n4. Modify CustomSAE with mixed precision\n5. Add stability metrics\n6. Implement visualization tools\n7. Add automated evaluation pipeline",
        "Interestingness_Evaluation": "The combination of sliding window statistics, adaptive grouping, and efficient training optimizations represents a highly practical yet theoretically sound approach to improving SAE feature quality.",
        "Interestingness": 9,
        "Feasibility_Evaluation": "The implementation is extremely feasible: sliding window statistics eliminate memory issues, adaptive grouping uses simple threshold checks, and mixed precision with gradient checkpointing is built into PyTorch; all components use standard operations and early stopping ensures training completes well within 30 minutes on an H100.",
        "Feasibility": 10,
        "Novelty_Evaluation": "The integration of sliding window statistics with adaptive grouping and efficient training optimizations represents a novel and highly practical approach to feature disentanglement.",
