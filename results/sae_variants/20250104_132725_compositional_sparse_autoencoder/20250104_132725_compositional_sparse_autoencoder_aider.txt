#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Compositional Sparse Autoencoders: Learning Interpretable Feature Combinations in Language Models.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: 1. Architecture modifications:  
####    - Two-stream architecture: feature extractor (d_f=256) and composition network (d_c=128)  
####    - Multi-head attention (8 heads) for feature composition  
####    - Residual connections with gating mechanism  
####    - Bottleneck layer enforcing sparsity (k=32)  
#### 2. Training procedure:  
####    - End-to-end training with graduated sparsity  
####    - Batch size 512, learning rate 3e-4  
####    - Composition complexity curriculum (2->4 feature combinations)  
#### 3. Evaluation framework:  
####    - Synthetic tests: arithmetic, boolean logic, simple grammar  
####    - Feature interaction analysis via attention patterns  
####    - Human evaluation (n=50) of feature interpretability  
####    - Comparison with PCA, NMF, and standard sparse AE  
#### 4. Analysis:  
####    - Ablation studies on architecture components  
####    - Composition pattern visualization  
####    - Feature reuse statistics.  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'shakespeare_char': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.8083514968554179, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.4693279266357422, 'total_train_time_mean': 301.409769932429, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 476.76571942025066}, 'enwik8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9414697289466858, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.0054575204849243, 'total_train_time_mean': 2371.9740512371063, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 481.0998539249739}, 'text8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9939898252487183, 'best_val_loss_mean': 0.9801777005195618, 'total_train_time_mean': 2351.458997964859, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 476.5669066097941}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

I'll plan out the experiments to evaluate the Compositional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) approach. Based on the baseline results and proposed architecture, here's my experimental plan:

Run 1: Initial CSAE Implementation
- Implement basic two-stream architecture with feature extractor and composition network
- Add multi-head attention and residual connections
- Use default hyperparameters (batch_size=512, lr=3e-4)
- Purpose: Establish basic functionality and initial performance comparison

Run 2: Graduated Sparsity & Curriculum
- Add graduated sparsity mechanism
- Implement composition complexity curriculum (2->4 features)
- Purpose: Evaluate impact of training procedure modifications

Run 3: Ablation Study
- Remove multi-head attention
- Remove residual connections
- Purpose: Analyze contribution of each architectural component

Run 4: Hyperparameter Optimization
- Adjust bottleneck size (k=32)
- Fine-tune learning rate and sparsity penalties
- Purpose: Optimize model performance

Run 5: Best Configuration
- Combine best performing components from previous runs
- Final evaluation and comparison with baseline
- Purpose: Produce final results for comparison

Let's start with Run 1 - implementing the basic CSAE architecture. I'll modify the CustomSAE class to include the two-stream architecture with attention:

```

This implementation includes:
1. Two-stream architecture with feature extractor (d_f=256) and composition network (d_c=128)
2. Multi-head attention (8 heads) for feature composition
3. Residual connections with gating mechanism
4. Bottleneck layer for sparsity

Let's run this first experiment to establish a baseline for the compositional approach. The command will be:

```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```

After we get the results from this run, we can proceed with Run 2 which will add the graduated sparsity and curriculum learning components.
