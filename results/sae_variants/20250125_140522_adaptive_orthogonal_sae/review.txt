    "Summary": "The paper presents MI-Ortho, a novel approach for feature disentanglement in large language models using mutual information-guided orthogonality penalties. The method leverages kernel density estimation to identify and constrain feature dependencies, aiming to capture non-linear interactions and improve feature separation while maintaining model performance. The paper demonstrates a 45% reduction in mean feature correlations compared to gradient-based baselines, but also reveals fundamental limitations, such as persistent zero unlearning scores.",
