# Title: Instantaneous Top-k Orthogonality Constraints for Feature Disentanglement
# Experiment description: 1. Select top 0.1% f_i*f_j pairs per batch
2. Apply orthogonality loss to selected pairs
3. Use L2 weight normalization on W_dec
4. Compare fixed vs adaptive Ï„ values
5. Measure absorption reduction efficiency
6. Analyze pair selection stability
7. Ablate top-k threshold impact

## Run 0: Baseline
Results: {'eval_type_id': 'sparse_probing', ...}
Description: Baseline results without orthogonality constraints.

## Run 1: Initial Top-k Implementation
Configuration:
- topk_percent: 0.001 (0.1% of feature pairs)
- ortho_weight: 0.1
- tau: 0.1 (fixed)
- L2 normalization on decoder weights

Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}

Description: First implementation of top-k orthogonality constraints. The training completed but the loss values were not properly captured in the results.

## Run 2: Loss Logging Implementation
Configuration:
- Same hyperparameters as Run 1
- Added detailed logging of:
  * Orthogonality loss per batch
  * L2 reconstruction loss
  * Sparsity (L1) loss
  * Number of unique features in top pairs
  * Max and mean pair correlations
  * Number of active features

Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': None, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}

Description: Run 2 implemented comprehensive loss logging but still showed issues with capturing the final loss values. The training appears to complete but the metrics aren't being properly stored in the final results dictionary. This suggests we need to fix the loss tracking mechanism and ensure proper storage of the training history.

## Run 3: Loss Tracking Fix
Configuration:
- topk_percent: 0.001
- ortho_weight: 0.1
- tau: 0.1
- Learning rate: 3e-4
- Sparsity penalty: 0.04

Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': {}, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04, 'final_metrics': {'total_loss': None, 'l2_loss': None, 'sparsity_loss': None, 'ortho_loss': None, 'active_features': None, 'unique_features_in_pairs': None}}

Description: Run 3 attempted to fix loss tracking but revealed an issue with loss accumulation. The training loop completed but failed to populate the loss dictionaries. This suggests we need to modify how losses are tracked during training and ensure they're properly accumulated before being stored in the final results.

## Run 4: Loss Accumulation Fix
Planned changes:
1. Initialize running_losses at the start of training
2. Ensure loss values are properly accumulated each step
3. Maintain running averages throughout training
4. Store final loss values before saving results
5. Keep same hyperparameters for comparison

Configuration:
- topk_percent: 0.001
- ortho_weight: 0.1
- tau: 0.1
- Learning rate: 3e-4
- Sparsity penalty: 0.04

Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': {'total_loss': 0.0, 'l2_loss': 0.0, 'sparsity_loss': 0.0, 'ortho_loss': 0.0, 'active_features': 0.0, 'unique_features_in_pairs': 0.0, 'max_pair_correlation': 0.0, 'mean_pair_correlation': 0.0}, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}

Description: Run 4 attempted to fix loss tracking by initializing running_losses and maintaining averages, but the results show that the loss values are still not being properly accumulated. All loss metrics are showing as 0.0, indicating that either the loss calculations are not being performed correctly or the averaging mechanism is failing to maintain the running totals. This suggests we need to modify how the loss values are calculated and stored in each training step.

## Run 5: Loss Calculation Fix
Planned changes:
1. Add explicit loss calculation in training loop
2. Ensure proper tensor handling for loss components
3. Fix running average calculation
4. Add validation checks for loss values
5. Keep same hyperparameters for comparison

Configuration:
- topk_percent: 0.001
- ortho_weight: 0.1
- tau: 0.1
- Learning rate: 3e-4
- Sparsity penalty: 0.04

Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': {'total_loss': 0.0, 'l2_loss': 0.0, 'sparsity_loss': 0.0, 'ortho_loss': 0.0, 'active_features': 0.0, 'unique_features_in_pairs': 0.0, 'max_pair_correlation': 0.0, 'mean_pair_correlation': 0.0}, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}

Description: Run 5 attempted to fix loss tracking by adding explicit loss calculations and validation checks, but the results still show all zero losses. This indicates a fundamental issue with either the loss computation or the way losses are being accumulated during training. The training appears to complete but no meaningful loss values are being captured. This suggests we need to:
1. Debug the loss computation in the forward pass
2. Verify tensor operations in loss calculations
3. Fix the running average mechanism
4. Add immediate validation after loss computation
5. Ensure proper gradient flow

## Run 6: Loss Computation Debug
Planned changes:
1. Add debug assertions for tensor operations
2. Fix loss accumulation in training loop
3. Implement proper running average calculation
4. Add gradient flow validation
5. Keep same hyperparameters for comparison

Configuration:
- topk_percent: 0.001
- ortho_weight: 0.1
- tau: 0.1
- Learning rate: 3e-4
- Sparsity penalty: 0.04

Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': {'total_loss': 0.0, 'l2_loss': 0.0, 'sparsity_loss': 0.0, 'ortho_loss': 0.0, 'active_features': 0.0, 'unique_features_in_pairs': 0.0, 'max_pair_correlation': 0.0, 'mean_pair_correlation': 0.0}}

Description: Run 6 implemented additional debug assertions and validation checks throughout the loss computation pipeline, but still resulted in zero losses. This indicates a more fundamental issue with the training loop itself rather than just the loss calculations. Key observations:
1. All loss components (L2, sparsity, orthogonality) are zero
2. No active features detected
3. No feature correlations measured
4. Training steps counter shows 0

The results suggest the training loop may not be executing properly or the activations buffer may not be providing valid input data. For Run 7, we need to:
1. Add validation of activation buffer contents
2. Verify training loop execution
3. Add step counting validation
4. Fix loss accumulation timing
5. Ensure proper metric updates

## Run 7: Training Loop Validation
Planned changes:
1. Add activation validation checks
2. Fix training step counter
3. Implement proper loss accumulation timing
4. Add comprehensive logging
5. Keep same hyperparameters for comparison

Configuration:
- topk_percent: 0.001
- ortho_weight: 0.1
- tau: 0.1
- Learning rate: 3e-4
- Sparsity penalty: 0.04

Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': {'total_loss': 0.0, 'l2_loss': 0.0, 'sparsity_loss': 0.0, 'ortho_loss': 0.0, 'active_features': 0.0, 'unique_features_in_pairs': 0.0, 'max_pair_correlation': 0.0, 'mean_pair_correlation': 0.0}, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}

Description: Run 7 implemented comprehensive validation checks and logging but revealed a critical issue: the training loop is not accumulating any steps or losses. The all-zero results suggest that either:
1. The activation buffer is not providing valid data
2. The loss calculations are not being properly accumulated
3. The step counter is not incrementing
4. The training loop may be exiting prematurely

This indicates we need to focus on the activation buffer and training loop mechanics for Run 8.

## Run 8: Activation Buffer and Training Loop Fix
Planned changes:
1. Add buffer validation in ActivationBuffer class
2. Implement proper batch processing
3. Fix step counting mechanism
4. Ensure training loop completion
5. Keep same hyperparameters for comparison

Configuration:
- topk_percent: 0.001
- ortho_weight: 0.1
- tau: 0.1
- Learning rate: 3e-4
- Sparsity penalty: 0.04

Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': {'total_loss': 0.0, 'l2_loss': 0.0, 'sparsity_loss': 0.0, 'ortho_loss': 0.0, 'active_features': 0.0, 'unique_features_in_pairs': 0.0, 'max_pair_correlation': 0.0, 'mean_pair_correlation': 0.0}, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304, 'learning_rate': 0.0003, 'sparsity_penalty': 0.04}

Description: Run 8 revealed that despite the buffer validation improvements, we're still seeing zero training steps and losses. The key issues identified:
1. The activation buffer is successfully loading but may not be properly concatenating batches
2. The training loop is exiting immediately, suggesting an issue with the step counting logic
3. Loss accumulation is not happening because no actual training steps are completed
4. The buffer refresh mechanism may be failing silently

For Run 9, we need to focus on:
1. Fix the activation concatenation in _refresh_buffer
2. Add explicit step counting in the training loop
3. Ensure proper batch size handling
4. Add debug logging for buffer state

## Run 9: Training Loop Step Counter Fix
Planned changes:
1. Fix activation concatenation in _refresh_buffer
2. Add explicit step counting in training loop
3. Ensure proper batch size handling
4. Add debug logging for buffer state

Configuration:
- topk_percent: 0.001
- ortho_weight: 0.1
- tau: 0.1
- Learning rate: 3e-4
- Sparsity penalty: 0.04

Results: {'training_steps': 0, 'final_loss': {'total_loss': 0.0, 'l2_loss': 0.0, 'sparsity_loss': 0.0, 'ortho_loss': 0.0, 'active_features': 0.0, 'unique_features_in_pairs': 0.0, 'max_pair_correlation': 0.0, 'mean_pair_correlation': 0.0}, 'layer': 19, 'dict_size': 2304}

Description: Run 9 attempted to fix the step counting and buffer issues but still shows zero training steps and losses. The debug logs reveal:
1. The buffer is successfully refreshing with correct shapes
2. The step counter logic is working as intended
3. The activation validation is passing
4. However, the training loop is still not accumulating any meaningful updates

For Run 10, we need to focus on:
1. Debug the optimizer step and gradient flow
2. Add gradient norm logging
3. Verify loss backpropagation
4. Check parameter updates
5. Validate optimizer state
