#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Compositional Sparse Autoencoders: Learning Interpretable Feature Combinations in Language Models.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: 1. Architecture modifications:  
####    - Two-stream architecture: feature extractor (d_f=256) and composition network (d_c=128)  
####    - Multi-head attention (8 heads) for feature composition  
####    - Residual connections with gating mechanism  
####    - Bottleneck layer enforcing sparsity (k=32)  
#### 2. Training procedure:  
####    - End-to-end training with graduated sparsity  
####    - Batch size 512, learning rate 3e-4  
####    - Composition complexity curriculum (2->4 feature combinations)  
#### 3. Evaluation framework:  
####    - Synthetic tests: arithmetic, boolean logic, simple grammar  
####    - Feature interaction analysis via attention patterns  
####    - Human evaluation (n=50) of feature interpretability  
####    - Comparison with PCA, NMF, and standard sparse AE  
#### 4. Analysis:  
####    - Ablation studies on architecture components  
####    - Composition pattern visualization  
####    - Feature reuse statistics.  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'shakespeare_char': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.8083514968554179, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.4693279266357422, 'total_train_time_mean': 301.409769932429, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 476.76571942025066}, 'enwik8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9414697289466858, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.0054575204849243, 'total_train_time_mean': 2371.9740512371063, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 481.0998539249739}, 'text8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9939898252487183, 'best_val_loss_mean': 0.9801777005195618, 'total_train_time_mean': 2351.458997964859, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 476.5669066097941}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

I'll help plan and implement the Compositional Sparse Autoencoder (CompSAE) experiments. Here's the proposed experiment plan:

Run 1: Implement core CompSAE architecture
- Two-stream architecture with feature extractor and composition network
- Multi-head attention for feature composition
- Basic residual connections and gating
- Initial sparsity settings

Run 2: Add graduated sparsity and curriculum learning
- Implement graduated sparsity schedule
- Add composition complexity curriculum (2->4 features)
- Tune learning dynamics

Run 3: Ablation study
- Remove attention mechanism
- Remove residual connections
- Compare against simpler architectures

Run 4: Analysis tools
- Add visualization capabilities
- Feature interaction analysis
- Reuse statistics tracking

Run 5: (Reserve for optimization based on previous results)

Let's start with Run 1 - implementing the core CompSAE architecture. I'll modify the CustomSAE class to implement the two-stream architecture with attention.

Here are the changes for Run 1:

This implementation for Run 1:

1. Adds two-stream architecture:
   - Feature extractor with d_f=256 dimensions
   - Composition network with d_c=128 dimensions
   - 8-head attention mechanism for feature composition

2. Implements residual connections and gating:
   - Residual connection around attention block
   - Gating mechanism to control feature combination flow
   - Layer normalization for stability

3. Sets up initial architecture for sparsity:
   - Dropout layers for regularization
   - Bottleneck structure through dimensionality reduction

To run this first experiment:

```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```

After we get the results from Run 1, we can proceed with Run 2 to implement the graduated sparsity and curriculum learning components.
