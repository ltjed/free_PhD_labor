    "Summary": "The paper proposes a novel framework for improving the interpretability of large language models using progressive feature learning in sparse autoencoders (SAEs). The main contributions include adaptive feature enabling and temperature-scaled competition, which aim to address feature collapse and inefficient capacity utilization. The framework is evaluated on the Gemma-2B model, showing significant improvements in sparsity and feature utilization while maintaining reasonable reconstruction quality.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper tackles a relevant and challenging problem in the field of model interpretability.",
        "The proposed adaptive feature enabling mechanism is innovative and addresses the issue of inefficient capacity utilization.",
        "The temperature-scaled competition mechanism is a novel approach to prevent feature collapse.",
        "The paper provides a variety of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The methodology section lacks clarity in several places, making it difficult to fully understand the implementation details.",
        "The paper does not provide enough ablation studies to isolate the effects of each proposed innovation.",
        "There is insufficient discussion on the limitations and potential trade-offs of the proposed methods.",
        "Reproducibility is a concern due to vague descriptions of certain components, such as the autoencoder aggregator and the specific implementation of the temperature-scaled competition.",
        "The trade-offs in reconstruction quality and model preservation metrics raise concerns about the overall effectiveness of the methods."

    "Questions": [
        "Can you provide more details on the implementation of the autoencoder aggregator?",
        "Could you include additional ablation studies to better isolate the effects of adaptive feature enabling and temperature-scaled competition?",
        "What are the potential trade-offs and limitations of your proposed methods?",
        "How can the reproducibility of the experiments be ensured given the current level of detail in the methodology?",
        "What is the performance of the proposed model with different types of aggregators?",
        "Can the authors provide more detailed theoretical backing for the temperature-scaled competition mechanism?",
        "How does the trade-off in reconstruction quality affect the practical applicability of the proposed method?",
        "Can the authors include more visual aids to clarify the key concepts and mechanisms proposed?",
        "How does your method compare against other state-of-the-art baselines in addition to the ones mentioned?",
        "Can the authors clarify the impact of temperature-scaled competition on feature selectivity, especially given the negative SCR scores at higher thresholds?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not sufficiently discuss the potential trade-offs and limitations of the proposed methods. For example, while the method improves sparsity, it also degrades reconstruction quality significantly. A more thorough analysis of these trade-offs is necessary.",
        "The reconstruction quality degrades by 53.6% (MSE: 28.63 vs 18.63).",
        "Model preservation scores drop by 39.3% (KL: 0.481 vs 0.793).",
        "Negative SCR scores at higher thresholds indicate reduced feature selectivity.",
        "Feature absorption remains unchanged despite sparsity improvements."
