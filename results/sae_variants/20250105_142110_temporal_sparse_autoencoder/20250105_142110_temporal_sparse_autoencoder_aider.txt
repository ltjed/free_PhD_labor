#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Temporal Sparse Autoencoders: Learning Interpretable Feature Dynamics in Language Models.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: 1. Architecture implementation:  
####    - LSTM-based encoder/decoder with sparse gates  
####    - Sliding window feature memory (window size w=16)  
####    - Feature lifecycle tracking module  
####    - Static-temporal bridge connections  
#### 2. Training procedure:  
####    - Initialize from pretrained static autoencoder  
####    - Three-phase training:  
####      a) Static feature distillation  
####      b) Temporal feature introduction  
####      c) End-to-end refinement  
####    - Progressive sparsity annealing  
#### 3. Evaluation methods:  
####    - Temporal stability score (TSS)  
####    - Feature lifetime analysis  
####    - Causal intervention tests  
####    - Temporal probing tasks:  
####      * Subject-verb agreement  
####      * Coreference resolution  
####      * Context-dependent disambiguation  
#### 4. Analysis:  
####    - Feature evolution visualization  
####    - Transition pattern mining  
####    - Ablation studies on window size  
####    - Comparison with baseline methods.  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'shakespeare_char': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.8083514968554179, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.4693279266357422, 'total_train_time_mean': 301.409769932429, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 476.76571942025066}, 'enwik8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9414697289466858, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.0054575204849243, 'total_train_time_mean': 2371.9740512371063, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 481.0998539249739}, 'text8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9939898252487183, 'best_val_loss_mean': 0.9801777005195618, 'total_train_time_mean': 2351.458997964859, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 476.5669066097941}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.
