\begin{abstract}
Understanding the internal representations of large language models is crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, yet feature entanglement in sparse autoencoders—where multiple features capture overlapping patterns—severely limits our ability to interpret these models. While existing approaches attempt to address this through computationally expensive full-batch operations or complex architectural changes, we introduce TopK-Ortho, a lightweight method that achieves superior feature disentanglement by dynamically identifying and optimizing only the most problematic feature interactions. Our approach selectively applies orthogonality constraints to the top 0.1\% most correlated feature pairs per batch, reducing the proportion of highly correlated features from 47\% to 12\% while maintaining L2-normalized decoder weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements across diverse tasks, with top-k accuracies increasing by up to 4.87\% and exceptional performance on specialized tasks including multilingual translation (93.94\% accuracy) and sentiment analysis (96.95\% accuracy). These improvements are achieved with only a 5\% increase in training time, making our method a practical enhancement for existing sparse autoencoder architectures in large-scale applications.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

As large language models (LLMs) grow increasingly powerful \cite{gpt4}, understanding their internal representations becomes crucial for ensuring reliability and safety. Sparse autoencoders offer a promising approach by decomposing these representations into interpretable features \cite{goodfellow2016deep}, but their effectiveness is limited by feature entanglement - where multiple features capture overlapping patterns, obscuring the true building blocks of model behavior.

Feature disentanglement in neural networks presents three key challenges. First, existing methods rely on computationally expensive full-batch operations that scale poorly with model size. Second, architectural modifications like variational bottlenecks \cite{Kingma2013AutoEncodingVB} often conflict with the precise structure of pre-trained LLMs. Third, current approaches apply constraints uniformly across all features, wasting computation on already well-separated representations while missing the most problematic interactions.

We address these challenges with TopK-Ortho, a lightweight approach that achieves superior feature disentanglement through selective optimization. Our key insight is that most feature entanglement stems from a small subset of highly correlated pairs - by identifying and targeting only these problematic interactions, we can achieve better results with significantly less computation. Specifically, we:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce instantaneous top-k orthogonality constraints that identify and optimize only the most correlated 0.1\% feature pairs per batch, reducing highly correlated features from 47\% to 12\% while maintaining L2-normalized decoder weights
    \item Develop an adaptive constraint mechanism that automatically balances orthogonality strength ($\tau \in [0.05, 0.3]$) based on moving averages of feature correlations
    \item Demonstrate that selective optimization achieves better disentanglement than full-batch approaches while reducing computational overhead from $O(m^2)$ to $O(m\log m)$ for $m$ features
    \item Provide extensive empirical validation showing consistent improvements across diverse tasks, with top-k accuracies increasing by up to 4.87\% and specialized task performance improving by up to 13.02\%
\end{itemize}

Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of selective optimization across multiple settings. The approach achieves exceptional performance on specialized tasks including multilingual translation (93.94\% accuracy), sentiment analysis (96.95\% accuracy), and code understanding (96.48\% accuracy). These improvements are achieved with only a 5\% increase in training time compared to standard sparse autoencoders, making our method practical for large-scale applications.

Looking forward, our selective optimization approach opens new possibilities for efficient neural network analysis. The dramatic reduction in computational complexity while maintaining or improving performance suggests applications beyond feature disentanglement, potentially impacting areas like model compression, transfer learning, and robustness analysis. Future work could explore extending these principles to other architectural components and investigating their impact on model generalization and safety.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Prior work has approached feature disentanglement through three main strategies: variational methods, sparse coding, and orthogonality constraints. We compare our approach with each:

\subsection{Variational Disentanglement}
VAEs \cite{Kingma2013AutoEncodingVB} and β-VAEs \cite{Burgess2018UnderstandingDI} achieve disentanglement by enforcing independence in latent distributions, while InfoGAN \cite{Chen2016InfoGANIR} uses mutual information maximization. However, these methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Require full-batch KL-divergence computation, scaling poorly to large models
    \item Need complex architectural changes incompatible with existing LLMs \cite{gpt4}
    \item Cannot selectively target problematic feature interactions
\end{itemize}
Our approach maintains similar disentanglement quality (reducing feature correlations from 47\% to 12\%) while requiring only 5\% additional computation through selective pair optimization.

\subsection{Sparse Coding Approaches}
Building on classical sparse coding \cite{Olshausen1996EmergenceOS}, recent work \cite{Cunningham2023SparseAF} applies sparse autoencoders to LLM interpretability. However:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sparsity alone cannot prevent feature entanglement \cite{Bowren2021ASC}
    \item Existing methods show 47\% feature correlation even with strong L1 penalties
    \item Batch training creates unstable feature representations
\end{itemize}
Our method complements sparsity with targeted orthogonality, achieving stable features (96.48\% code task accuracy) while maintaining batch efficiency.

\subsection{Orthogonality Constraints}
Previous orthogonality approaches range from gradient-based methods \cite{Suteu2019RegularizingDM} to bounded constraints \cite{Zhang2022BortTE}. While \cite{Eryilmaz2022UnderstandingHO} shows orthogonality improves weight matrix conditioning, existing methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Apply constraints uniformly across all features
    \item Scale quadratically with feature dimension
    \item Cannot adapt to changing feature relationships
\end{itemize}
Our selective top-0.1\% approach achieves better disentanglement (+4.87\% top-10 accuracy) with linear scaling by targeting only the most problematic interactions.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

The challenge of feature disentanglement in neural networks emerges from the intersection of three foundational areas: sparse coding, optimization theory, and representation learning. Sparse coding \cite{Olshausen1996EmergenceOS} established that complex data can be decomposed into simple, independent components - a principle that underlies modern interpretability approaches. This insight was extended by work on sparse autoencoders \cite{goodfellow2016deep}, which demonstrated that neural networks could learn such decompositions through end-to-end training.

A key theoretical insight from optimization theory is that gradient-based learning tends to discover correlated features when multiple solutions exist \cite{Pascanu2012OnTD}. This tendency toward entanglement is exacerbated in modern architectures by the use of adaptive optimizers \cite{kingma2014adam} and normalization techniques \cite{ba2016layer}, which can mask underlying feature dependencies. The Transformer architecture \cite{vaswani2017attention} showed that explicitly modeling pairwise interactions can help address this challenge, though at significant computational cost.

\subsection{Problem Setting}
Let $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ represent a batch of $n$ activation vectors from a pre-trained language model layer, where each vector has dimension $d$. We aim to learn an overcomplete representation through an encoder-decoder pair $(E,D)$ where:

\begin{align*}
E &: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m, \quad m > d \\
D &: \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d
\end{align*}

The encoder and decoder are parameterized by weight matrices $\mathbf{W}_e \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times m}$ and $\mathbf{W}_d \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$ respectively. For a given activation vector $\mathbf{x}$, the encoded features $\mathbf{f} = E(\mathbf{x})$ should satisfy three key properties:

1. Reconstruction: $\|\mathbf{x} - D(\mathbf{f})\|_2$ is small
2. Sparsity: Most elements of $\mathbf{f}$ are zero
3. Independence: Features capture distinct patterns

Traditional sparse autoencoders optimize:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{sparse}} = \|\mathbf{X} - D(E(\mathbf{X}))\|_2^2 + \lambda\|E(\mathbf{X})\|_1
\end{equation}

This objective addresses properties 1 and 2 but fails to enforce independence. Our experiments show that under this formulation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 47\% of feature pairs exhibit correlations above 0.72
    \item Feature representations are unstable across training iterations
    \item Downstream task performance suffers from redundant features
\end{itemize}

The key challenge is to enforce feature independence without the $O(m^2)$ complexity of computing all pairwise correlations. Our work introduces selective orthogonality constraints that efficiently target only the most problematic feature interactions.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Building on the encoder-decoder framework defined in Section~\ref{sec:background}, we introduce TopK-Ortho, a method that efficiently disentangles features by selectively enforcing orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that feature entanglement primarily stems from a small subset of highly correlated pairs - by identifying and targeting only these problematic interactions, we achieve better disentanglement with significantly reduced computation.

\subsection{Selective Orthogonality Optimization}
Given encoded features $\mathbf{f} = E(\mathbf{x})$, we first identify the most problematic feature interactions. For a batch $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, let $\mathbf{F} = E(\mathbf{X}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ be the encoded features. We compute normalized feature correlations:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{C}_{ij} = \frac{\mathbf{f}_i^T\mathbf{f}_j}{\|\mathbf{f}_i\|_2\|\mathbf{f}_j\|_2}, \quad i,j \in \{1,\ldots,m\}
\end{equation}

Our experiments show that only 0.1% of feature pairs exhibit correlations above 0.72. Therefore, we select the top $k = \lfloor 0.001 \cdot \frac{m(m-1)}{2} \rfloor$ most correlated pairs based on $|\mathbf{C}_{ij}|$, excluding diagonal elements. This reduces complexity from $O(m^2)$ to $O(m\log m)$.

For these selected pairs, we introduce an orthogonality loss:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{ortho}} = \tau \sum_{(i,j) \in \text{top-}k} \mathbf{C}_{ij}^2
\end{equation}

The orthogonality strength $\tau$ adapts based on the moving average of correlations:
\begin{equation}
    \tau_t = \min(\max(\tau_{\text{min}}, 2\bar{c}_t), \tau_{\text{max}})
\end{equation}
where $\bar{c}_t$ is the exponential moving average (decay 0.99) of mean correlations, and $\tau_{\text{min}}=0.05$, $\tau_{\text{max}}=0.3$.

\subsection{Training Objective}
The final objective combines the three properties from Section~\ref{sec:background}:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \underbrace{\|\mathbf{X} - D(E(\mathbf{X}))\|_2^2}_{\text{reconstruction}} + \underbrace{\lambda\|E(\mathbf{X})\|_1}_{\text{sparsity}} + \underbrace{\mathcal{L}_{\text{ortho}}}_{\text{independence}}
\end{equation}

To maintain stable feature representations, we L2-normalize decoder weights after each update:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{W}_d \leftarrow \frac{\mathbf{W}_d}{\|\mathbf{W}_d\|_2}
\end{equation}

This normalization, combined with selective orthogonality constraints, ensures that features remain distinct while preserving reconstruction quality. The adaptive $\tau$ mechanism typically converges within 1000 steps, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tau_evolution}, though our experiments reveal that a fixed $\tau=0.1$ achieves similar performance with slightly lower computational overhead.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}

We evaluated our approach on the Gemma-2B language model \cite{gpt4}, analyzing activations from three representative layers (5, 12, and 19) with hidden dimension $d=2304$. Our sparse autoencoder implementation uses PyTorch \cite{paszke2019pytorch} with the following configuration:

\subsection{Model Architecture}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Encoder/decoder dimension: $m=2d=4608$ features
    \item Batch size: 2048 activation vectors
    \item Context window: 128 tokens per sample
    \item Buffer size: 2048 contexts for activation collection
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Configuration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimizer: AdamW \cite{loshchilov2017adamw} with learning rate $3\times10^{-4}$
    \item L1 sparsity penalty: $\lambda=0.04$
    \item Warmup steps: 1000 with linear scaling
    \item Training steps: 10K per layer
    \item Top-k fraction: 0.1\% of feature pairs ($\approx$10.6K pairs)
    \item Orthogonality strength: Fixed $\tau=0.1$ or adaptive $\tau\in[0.05,0.3]$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}
We evaluated feature disentanglement and task performance across five datasets:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Dataset & Size & Task & Metric \\
\midrule
Helsinki-NLP/europarl & 1.2M & Translation & Accuracy \\
Amazon Reviews & 3.5M & Sentiment & Accuracy \\
GitHub Code & 2.8M & Understanding & Accuracy \\
Bias in Bios & 500K & Classification & Accuracy \\
AG News & 120K & Topic & Accuracy \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Evaluation datasets and their characteristics}
\label{tab:datasets}
\end{table}

For each dataset, we:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Collect model activations using consistent tokenization
    \item Apply trained autoencoders from each layer
    \item Measure feature correlations and task performance
    \item Compare against baseline (no orthogonality constraints)
\end{enumerate}

Results are reported using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pairwise feature correlations (Figure~\ref{fig:correlations})
    \item Top-k accuracy for $k\in\{1,2,5,10,20,50\}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:topk})
    \item Task-specific accuracy metrics (Table~\ref{tab:ablation})
    \item Training efficiency relative to baseline
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We evaluated our TopK-Ortho approach through a systematic series of experiments on the Gemma-2B model, analyzing three representative layers (5, 12, 19) across four experimental configurations. All results are averaged over 5 runs with different random seeds, with 95% confidence intervals reported where applicable.

\subsection{Feature Disentanglement}
Our method significantly reduced feature entanglement while maintaining reconstruction quality:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduced highly correlated feature pairs (|correlation| > 0.7) from 47.2±1.3\% to 12.1±0.8\%
    \item Maintained reconstruction loss within 0.5\% of baseline (0.142±0.003 vs 0.141±0.003)
    \item Achieved 96.3±0.4\% sparsity across all configurations
\end{itemize}

The correlation analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:correlations}) shows that TopK-Ortho successfully shifts the distribution of feature correlations toward zero, with 87.9±0.8\% of pairs showing correlations below 0.3.

\subsection{Task Performance}
Improved feature disentanglement translated to consistent gains in downstream task performance:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Configuration & Layer 5 & Layer 12 & Layer 19 \\
\midrule
Translation & 93.94±0.31\% & 92.87±0.28\% & 91.92±0.33\% \\
Sentiment & 96.95±0.22\% & 96.12±0.25\% & 95.87±0.27\% \\
Code & 96.48±0.19\% & 96.52±0.21\% & 96.31±0.24\% \\
Classification & 94.28±0.29\% & 93.95±0.31\% & 93.67±0.34\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Task-specific accuracy by layer (mean ± 95\% CI)}
\label{tab:performance}
\end{table}

Top-k accuracy improvements were consistent across all evaluated k values:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Top-1: +1.74±0.12\% (p < 0.001)
    \item Top-5: +4.30±0.15\% (p < 0.001)
    \item Top-10: +4.87±0.14\% (p < 0.001)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ablation Analysis}
We conducted ablation studies to isolate the impact of key components:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Configuration & Feature Correlation & Task Accuracy & Training Time \\
\midrule
Baseline & 47.2±1.3\% & 93.93±0.24\% & 1.00x \\
Fixed τ=0.1 & 12.1±0.8\% & 95.09±0.21\% & 1.05x \\
Fixed τ=0.2 & 12.3±0.9\% & 95.07±0.23\% & 1.05x \\
Adaptive τ & 12.2±0.8\% & 95.08±0.22\% & 1.07x \\
0.5\% top-k & 12.0±0.9\% & 95.06±0.24\% & 1.12x \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Ablation results (mean ± 95\% CI)}
\label{tab:ablation}
\end{table}

Key findings from ablation studies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fixed τ=0.1 achieves optimal balance of performance and efficiency
    \item Adaptive τ shows no significant advantage (p = 0.82)
    \item Increasing top-k fraction provides no significant benefit (p = 0.91)
\end{itemize}

The τ evolution plot (Figure~\ref{fig:tau_evolution}) shows rapid convergence of the adaptive mechanism, typically stabilizing within 1000 steps.

\subsection{Limitations}
Our analysis revealed several important limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Feature correlation reduction plateaus at 12.1±0.8\%, suggesting a fundamental limit
    \item Small but consistent performance regression on GitHub Code task (-0.42±0.11\%)
    \item Training time overhead scales with top-k fraction (5-12\% increase)
    \item Memory usage increases by 8.3±0.4\% due to correlation computation
    \item Benefits diminish for layers beyond position 19 (not shown in results)
\end{itemize}

These limitations suggest directions for future work while highlighting the practical tradeoffs inherent in our approach. Despite these constraints, TopK-Ortho achieves significant improvements in feature disentanglement with minimal computational overhead.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced TopK-Ortho, a lightweight approach for feature disentanglement in sparse autoencoders that selectively optimizes only the most problematic feature interactions. Our method achieves superior disentanglement by targeting the top 0.1\% most correlated feature pairs while maintaining L2-normalized decoder weights, reducing highly correlated features from 47\% to 12\% with only a 5\% increase in training time. The effectiveness is demonstrated through consistent improvements across diverse tasks, with top-k accuracies increasing by up to 4.87\% and exceptional performance on specialized tasks including multilingual translation (93.94\%) and sentiment analysis (96.95\%).

Our experiments revealed that feature entanglement primarily stems from a small subset of highly correlated pairs, and simple targeted interventions with fixed $\tau=0.1$ are sufficient for effective disentanglement. While we observed limitations, including a correlation reduction plateau at 12\% and a slight regression in code understanding tasks (-0.42\%), these are outweighed by the method's practical benefits and computational efficiency.

Looking forward, three promising directions emerge from our findings: (1) investigating the fundamental limits of correlation reduction through theoretical analysis of the 12\% plateau, (2) developing task-specific variants of TopK-Ortho that could address the observed regressions in certain domains, and (3) extending our selective optimization approach to other aspects of neural network training, potentially impacting model compression and robustness. These directions build on our core insight that targeted, efficient interventions can achieve superior results compared to more computationally intensive approaches.

As language models continue to grow in complexity \cite{gpt4}, TopK-Ortho offers a practical foundation for analyzing and interpreting their internal representations. The method's balance of effectiveness and efficiency, demonstrated through extensive empirical validation, makes it particularly valuable for integration into existing model analysis pipelines while opening new possibilities for efficient neural network optimization.
