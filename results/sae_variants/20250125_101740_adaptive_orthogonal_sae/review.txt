    "Summary": "The paper proposes TopK-Ortho, a method to enhance feature disentanglement in sparse autoencoders by selectively applying orthogonality constraints to the top 0.1% most correlated feature pairs. This approach aims to reduce feature correlation and improve task performance with minimal computational overhead. The paper claims significant improvements in feature disentanglement and task-specific performance across various datasets.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The method addresses a crucial issue in sparse autoencoders, i.e., feature entanglement, which is important for interpretability.",
        "The selective application of orthogonality constraints is novel and aims to reduce computational overhead compared to full-batch methods.",
        "The paper reports significant improvements in feature disentanglement and task performance across diverse datasets.",
        "The approach is reported to increase training time by only 5%, making it practical for large-scale applications."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks clarity in explaining the detailed steps of the proposed method, especially the computation of normalized feature correlations and the adaptive mechanism for orthogonality strength.",
        "The experimental setup, including hyperparameters and training configurations, is not sufficiently detailed, making it difficult to reproduce the results.",
        "The paper provides limited ablation studies and does not explore the impact of varying the top-k fraction or the choice of orthogonality strength in detail.",
        "The performance claims might be overgeneralized without sufficient evidence from a broader set of datasets and tasks.",
        "There is a need for more qualitative analysis or visualizations to support the quantitative results."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors provide more details on the computation of normalized feature correlations and the adaptive mechanism for orthogonality strength?",
        "How does the performance of the proposed method vary with different top-k fractions and orthogonality strengths?",
        "Can the authors provide more ablation studies to isolate the impact of each component of the proposed method?",
        "Can the authors provide more qualitative analysis or visualizations to support the quantitative results?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not sufficiently address the limitations of the proposed method, such as the potential impact on different types of tasks and datasets.",
        "The computational overhead, while claimed to be minimal, is not thoroughly analyzed, especially in terms of memory usage and scalability to larger models.",
        "The method primarily targets feature disentanglement in sparse autoencoders. Its applicability to other architectures or tasks is not fully explored.",
        "The potential risk of overfitting due to selective optimization of a small subset of feature pairs."
