    "Summary": "The paper introduces Position-Aware Sparse Autoencoders (PA-SAEs) to enhance interpretability in neural networks by capturing position-specific feature patterns. The method combines learnable position-specific masks, adaptive learning rates, and gradient-based importance weighting. Experiments on the Gemma-2B model show improvements in position-sensitive tasks but performance trade-offs in content-focused tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The proposed PA-SAE method is innovative in combining sparse autoencoders with position-specific feature extraction mechanisms.",
        "The paper addresses an important problem of understanding temporal dependencies in neural networks.",
        "Experimental results show significant improvements in position-sensitive tasks, indicating the method's effectiveness in such scenarios."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper's clarity is subpar, with complex equations and jargon making it difficult to follow the core contributions and methodology.",
        "Theoretical justifications for the assumptions made by the proposed method are lacking.",
        "The empirical validation is incomplete, with limited ablation studies and no exploration of alternative architectures or datasets.",
        "Performance degradation on content-focused tasks and significant computational overhead limit the broader applicability and impact of the method.",
        "Important implementation details, such as the specific role of the autoencoder aggregator, are not clearly explained."

        "How does the method handle sequences longer than 128 tokens, and what are the implications for longer context lengths?",
        "Can the authors provide more details on the autoencoder aggregator?",
        "How do the proposed modifications (soft masking, adaptive learning) impact the results individually?",

    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not adequately address the limitations related to the performance trade-off on content-focused tasks and the significant computational overhead.",
        "The lack of theoretical backing for the assumptions and the incomplete empirical validation are major concerns.",
        "The increased computational overhead and limited evaluation on position-agnostic tasks are notable limitations. Additionally, the performance trade-offs suggest that the method may overfit to position-sensitive tasks, reducing its general applicability.",
        "The paper could benefit from more detailed explanations of the proposed components and their individual contributions to the overall performance."
