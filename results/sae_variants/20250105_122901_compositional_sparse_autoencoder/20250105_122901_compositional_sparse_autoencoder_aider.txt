#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Compositional Sparse Autoencoders: Learning Interpretable Feature Combinations in Language Models.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: 1. Architecture modifications:  
####    - Two-stream architecture: feature extractor (d_f=256) and composition network (d_c=128)  
####    - Multi-head attention (8 heads) for feature composition  
####    - Residual connections with gating mechanism  
####    - Bottleneck layer enforcing sparsity (k=32)  
#### 2. Training procedure:  
####    - End-to-end training with graduated sparsity  
####    - Batch size 512, learning rate 3e-4  
####    - Composition complexity curriculum (2->4 feature combinations)  
#### 3. Evaluation framework:  
####    - Synthetic tests: arithmetic, boolean logic, simple grammar  
####    - Feature interaction analysis via attention patterns  
####    - Human evaluation (n=50) of feature interpretability  
####    - Comparison with PCA, NMF, and standard sparse AE  
#### 4. Analysis:  
####    - Ablation studies on architecture components  
####    - Composition pattern visualization  
####    - Feature reuse statistics.  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'shakespeare_char': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.8083514968554179, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.4693279266357422, 'total_train_time_mean': 301.409769932429, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 476.76571942025066}, 'enwik8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9414697289466858, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.0054575204849243, 'total_train_time_mean': 2371.9740512371063, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 481.0998539249739}, 'text8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9939898252487183, 'best_val_loss_mean': 0.9801777005195618, 'total_train_time_mean': 2351.458997964859, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 476.5669066097941}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

I'll help plan and implement the compositional sparse autoencoder experiments. Based on the requirements, here's my proposed plan for the 5 runs:

Run 1: Implement the basic compositional architecture
- Two-stream architecture with feature extractor and composition network
- Multi-head attention for composition
- Basic residual connections and sparsity

Run 2: Add graduated sparsity and gating
- Implement graduated sparsity training
- Add gating mechanism to residual connections
- Keep other parameters same as Run 1

Run 3: Implement curriculum learning
- Add composition complexity curriculum (2->4 features)
- Keep graduated sparsity and gating
- Tune hyperparameters based on Run 2 results

Run 4: Ablation study
- Remove multi-head attention
- Remove gating
- Keep only feature extractor stream
To understand component contributions

Run 5: Compare with baselines
- Add PCA and NMF baselines
- Run comparative evaluation
- Generate visualization data

Let's start with Run 1 by implementing the basic compositional architecture. I'll modify the VanillaSAE class to create a CompositionalSAE.

Here are the changes for Run 1:

This implements the basic compositional architecture with:
- Two-stream architecture (feature extractor d_f=256 and composition network d_c=128)
- Multi-head attention (8 heads) for feature composition  
- Residual connections
- Bottleneck layer with top-k sparsity (k=32)

The key changes are:
1. Split encoder into feature extractor and composition streams
2. Added multi-head attention for composition
3. Added bottleneck layer with explicit sparsity control
4. Added residual connections from feature extractor

We can run this first experiment with:
```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```

After we see the results, we can proceed with Run 2 to add graduated sparsity and gating mechanisms. Would you like me to proceed with running this first experiment?

I notice the error is that the model name "pythia-70m-deduped" is not found on Hugging Face. Let me help fix this by using the correct model identifier.

Looking at the error and the model name, we should use "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped" instead, which is the full model identifier on Hugging Face.

Here are the changes needed:

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    model_name = "pythia-70m-deduped"
=======
    model_name = "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    # model_name = "gemma-2-2b"
    d_model = MODEL_CONFIGS[model_name]["d_model"]
=======
    # model_name = "google/gemma-2b" 
    d_model = MODEL_CONFIGS[model_name]["d_model"] if model_name in MODEL_CONFIGS else 512
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
MODEL_CONFIGS = {
    "pythia-70m-deduped": {"batch_size": 512, "dtype": "float32", "layers": [3, 4], "d_model": 512},
    "gemma-2-2b": {"batch_size": 32, "dtype": "bfloat16", "layers": [5, 12, 19], "d_model": 2304},
}
=======
MODEL_CONFIGS = {
    "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped": {"batch_size": 512, "dtype": "float32", "layers": [3, 4], "d_model": 512},
    "google/gemma-2b": {"batch_size": 32, "dtype": "bfloat16", "layers": [5, 12, 19], "d_model": 2304},
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Update the model name to use the full identifier "EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped"
2. Add a fallback for d_model in case the model isn't in MODEL_CONFIGS
3. Update the MODEL_CONFIGS dictionary with the correct model identifiers

Try running the experiment again with:

```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```
