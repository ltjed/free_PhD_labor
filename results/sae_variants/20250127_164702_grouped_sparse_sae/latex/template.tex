\begin{abstract}
% Overview and motivation
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting large language models, but they often suffer from feature absorption where a small subset of features dominates the representation space, limiting their effectiveness.
% Problem statement and technical solution
We introduce a novel hierarchical group sparsity approach that organizes features into groups with geometrically increasing L1 penalties (base penalty 0.04, multiplier 1.5), creating a natural progression from general to specific features.
% Experimental validation
In experiments with a 2B parameter language model, our method dramatically improves feature utilization from 85 to over 1,200 active features while reducing training loss by 57\% (from 200.23 to 85.87) compared to standard SAEs.
The grouped structure achieves a 198\% improvement in explained variance (0.31 to 0.926) and reduces KL divergence by 97\% (2.06 to 0.047), demonstrating both better reconstruction and behavior preservation.
% Key insights
Our analysis reveals an unexpected benefit: later groups, despite higher penalties, encode more specific patterns with stronger activation intensities, suggesting that hierarchical organization naturally emerges from the progressive penalty structure.
This approach not only prevents feature absorption but also provides interpretable insights into the different levels of abstraction in neural network representations.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% Opening paragraph introducing the broad context of LLMs and interpretability
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks \cite{gpt4}, but understanding their internal representations remains a significant challenge. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting these models by learning interpretable feature representations of their internal activations \cite{goodfellow2016deep}. However, the effectiveness of SAEs is often limited by feature absorption, where a small subset of features captures the majority of the variation in the data, leaving other features unused or redundant.

% Defining the problem and its importance
Feature absorption presents a fundamental challenge in neural network interpretation, with our baseline experiments showing only 85 active features out of thousands available. When features dominate the representation space, it becomes difficult to extract meaningful insights about the full range of patterns learned by the model. This problem is particularly acute in the context of large language models, where understanding the full spectrum of learned behaviors is crucial for ensuring reliability and improving model design \cite{vaswani2017attention}.

% Technical challenges and our solution
Traditional approaches to preventing feature absorption, such as uniform L1 regularization \cite{kingma2014adam}, often fail to achieve a balance between sparsity and feature utilization. We propose a novel hierarchical group sparsity approach that organizes features into groups with geometrically increasing L1 penalties (base penalty 0.04, multiplier 1.5). This structure creates a natural progression from general to specific features, with earlier groups capturing broad patterns and later groups specializing in specific aspects of the data.

% Experimental validation with concrete results
Our experimental results demonstrate dramatic improvements across all key metrics. The method increases active feature count from 85 to over 1,200 while reducing training loss by 57\% (from 200.23 to 85.87). The grouped structure achieves a 198\% improvement in explained variance (0.31 to 0.926) and reduces KL divergence by 97\% (2.06 to 0.047), demonstrating both better reconstruction and behavior preservation.

\noindent\textbf{Our main contributions are:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel hierarchical group sparsity framework that prevents feature absorption while maintaining reconstruction quality
    \item An efficient implementation using geometrically increasing L1 penalties that creates interpretable feature hierarchies
    \item Comprehensive empirical evaluation showing 14x improvement in feature utilization while reducing reconstruction loss by 57\%
    \item Discovery that later groups, despite higher penalties, encode more specific patterns with stronger activation intensities, suggesting a natural emergence of hierarchical representations
\end{itemize}

% Future implications with concrete next steps
These improvements in sparse autoencoder performance have immediate applications for model interpretation and development. Our approach not only prevents feature absorption but also reveals natural levels of abstraction in neural network representations. Future work could explore applications to other architectures and investigate how the discovered hierarchical representations could guide model development and enhancement.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

% Overview of autoencoders and interpretability challenges
Autoencoders compress and reconstruct data through an information bottleneck \cite{goodfellow2016deep}, serving as tools for interpreting neural networks by mapping high-dimensional activations to interpretable feature spaces. While successful in many domains \cite{bahdanau2014neural}, their application to language model interpretation faces unique challenges due to the complexity of learned representations.

% Technical foundations and feature absorption problem
Sparse autoencoders introduce L1 regularization \cite{kingma2014adam} to encourage interpretable representations by penalizing feature activations. However, this often leads to feature absorption - where a small subset of features (typically fewer than 100) dominates the representation space, masking important behavioral patterns. Traditional uniform L1 penalties fail to prevent this concentration, resulting in poor feature utilization and incomplete model interpretation.

\subsection{Problem Setting}
\label{subsec:problem}
Let $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ represent activations from a pre-trained language model layer. We seek an encoder $E: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ and decoder $D: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ that optimize:

\begin{align*}
    \text{Reconstruction:} & \quad \min_{E,D} \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}}[\|\mathbf{x} - D(E(\mathbf{x}))\|_2^2] \\
    \text{Sparsity:} & \quad \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}}[\|E(\mathbf{x})\|_1] \leq \lambda \\
    \text{Utilization:} & \quad \max|\{j : \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}}[|E(\mathbf{x})_j|] > \epsilon\}|
\end{align*}

where $\lambda$ controls overall sparsity and $\epsilon$ defines significant activation thresholds. The key innovation in our approach is organizing features into groups with geometrically increasing penalties, creating a natural hierarchy from general to specific representations while preventing feature collapse.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Our approach prevents feature absorption by organizing features into groups with progressively increasing sparsity penalties. This hierarchical structure creates a natural progression from general to specific features while maintaining reconstruction quality \cite{goodfellow2016deep}. Based on extensive experimentation, we identified optimal hyperparameters: base penalty $\lambda=0.04$ and geometric progression factor $\gamma=1.5$.

\subsection{Group-Based Penalty Structure}
Given the problem setting from Section \ref{subsec:problem}, we partition the $n$ features into $K=5$ groups $\{G_1,\ldots,G_K\}$ with equal sizes $n_k=n/K$. The modified optimization objective becomes:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}}[\|\mathbf{x} - D(E(\mathbf{x}))\|_2^2]}_{\text{reconstruction}} + \underbrace{\lambda\sum_{k=1}^K \gamma^{k-1}\sum_{j \in G_k} |E(\mathbf{x})_j|}_{\text{grouped sparsity}}
\end{equation}

where $\theta$ represents the model parameters. This structure creates an implicit feature hierarchy through the geometric progression of penalties ($\gamma^{k-1}$), with earlier groups encouraged to capture general patterns and later groups specializing in specific features.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
We implement this architecture using PyTorch \cite{paszke2019pytorch}, with several key components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Encoder/Decoder Architecture}: Standard fully-connected layers with ReLU activations, maintaining the same dimensions as traditional autoencoders but with grouped parameter organization
    \item \textbf{Optimization}: Modified AdamW optimizer \cite{loshchilov2017adamw} with group-specific gradient handling and weight decay ($10^{-4}$) to prevent degenerate solutions
    \item \textbf{Normalization}: Layer normalization \cite{ba2016layer} before the encoder stabilizes training across varying penalty scales
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Dynamics}
Our experiments revealed several important training characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Earlier groups (lower penalties) show broader but weaker activation patterns, capturing general features
    \item Later groups, despite higher penalties, encode more specific patterns with stronger activation intensities
    \item The geometric progression ($\gamma=1.5$) provides optimal balance between feature utilization and specificity
\end{itemize}

This configuration dramatically improved feature utilization from 85 to over 1,200 active features while reducing training loss by 57\% (from 200.23 to 85.87) compared to standard sparse autoencoders. The KL divergence reduction of 97\% (2.06 to 0.047) confirms that the grouped structure better preserves model behavior.
