    "Summary": "The paper proposes a hierarchical group sparsity approach to address feature absorption in sparse autoencoders (SAEs) used for interpreting large language models (LLMs). The method organizes features into groups with geometrically increasing L1 penalties, aiming to improve feature utilization and reconstruction quality. The empirical results on a 2B parameter language model show significant improvements across multiple metrics.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses the critical issue of feature absorption in SAEs, which is significant for interpreting LLMs.",
        "Introduces a novel hierarchical group sparsity approach that organizes features into groups with geometrically increasing penalties.",
        "Provides comprehensive empirical validation with a 2B parameter language model, showing substantial improvements across multiple metrics."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "The methodology and implementation details are not clearly explained, making it difficult to reproduce the results.",
        "The paper lacks ablation studies to explore the impact of different components of the approach, such as the choice of geometric progression factor and base penalty.",
        "The empirical validation, while extensive, does not fully explore potential limitations or alternative explanations for the results.",
        "The paper does not adequately address the potential negative societal impacts of the work.",
        "The practical applicability and scalability of the proposed method are not thoroughly discussed."
