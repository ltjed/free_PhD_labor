# Experiment description: 1. Implement dilated depth-wise convolutions
2. Add cosine-based feature separation loss
3. Train on Gemma activation sequences
4. Evaluate on WMDP-bio unlearning benchmark
5. Compare against baseline SAEs
6. Analyze feature disentanglement

## Run 0: Baseline
Results: [Previous baseline results...]
Description: Baseline results using standard SAE architecture.

## Run 1: Basic MS-TSAE Implementation
Description: Initial implementation of Multi-Scale Temporal SAE with the following key components:
1. Three parallel dilated convolution branches with dilation rates (1,2,4)
2. Depth-wise convolutions to maintain parameter efficiency
3. Cosine-based feature separation loss (weight 0.1)
4. Temporal context window of 128 tokens

Technical details:
- Architecture: MS-TSAE with 3 parallel temporal branches
- Model: google/gemma-2-2b
- Layer: 19
- Dict size: 2304
- Learning rate: 0.0003
- Sparsity penalty: 0.04

Results on Unlearning Task:
- Unlearning score: 0.0
- Eval ID: 1a043892-ea3b-476b-8b02-18d6e05fb68b
- Dataset: WMDP-bio

Analysis: The initial MS-TSAE implementation showed poor unlearning performance, suggesting that the temporal convolutions may be interfering with the model's ability to isolate and suppress specific features. This motivates our next experiment (Run 2) where we remove the feature separation loss to better understand the interaction between temporal modeling and feature isolation.

## Run 2: Temporal SAE without Feature Separation
Description: Ablation study removing cosine feature separation loss while maintaining multi-scale temporal convolutions.

Technical details:
- Architecture: Temporal SAE with 3 parallel temporal branches (dilation rates 1,2,4)
- Model: google/gemma-2-2b
- Layer: 19
- Dict size: 2304
- Learning rate: 0.0003
- Sparsity penalty: 0.04
- Key change: Removed feature separation loss

Results on Unlearning Task:
- Unlearning score: 0.0
- Eval ID: 7a2164d7-140e-4b87-a78d-56b55592379c
- Dataset: WMDP-bio

Analysis: The removal of feature separation loss did not improve unlearning performance, with the score remaining at 0.0. This suggests that the challenge lies not in the feature separation mechanism but potentially in the complexity of the multi-scale temporal convolutions themselves. The parallel branches may be creating feature representations that are too interdependent for effective unlearning. This motivates our next experiment (Run 3) where we will simplify to a single temporal scale to reduce architectural complexity while maintaining temporal awareness.

## Run 3: Single-Scale Temporal SAE
Description: Simplification study using only a single temporal convolution to reduce architectural complexity while maintaining temporal awareness.

Technical details:
- Architecture: Single-Scale Temporal SAE with one depth-wise convolution
- Model: google/gemma-2-2b
- Layer: 19
- Dict size: 2304
- Learning rate: 0.0003
- Sparsity penalty: 0.04
- Key change: Single temporal convolution (dilation rate 1)

Results on Unlearning Task:
- Unlearning score: 0.0
- Eval ID: 6e0dffb5-a6d6-4333-90c1-186ac2f36b40
- Dataset: WMDP-bio
- Evaluation timestamp: 1737322539023
- Model configuration: gemma-2-2b-it
- Evaluation parameters:
  * Random seed: 42
  * Dataset size: 1024
  * Sequence length: 1024
  * Batch size: 32
  * Data type: bfloat16
  * Multiple datasets tested: WMDP-bio, high_school_us_history, college_computer_science, high_school_geography, human_aging

Analysis: The single-scale temporal convolution approach maintained the unlearning score at 0.0, consistent with previous experimental runs. This comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets reinforces our earlier observations about the limitations of temporal modeling approaches. The consistent performance across different subject domains (biology, history, computer science, geography, aging) suggests that the challenge is fundamental to the architecture rather than domain-specific.

Key observations:
1. Temporal convolution complexity does not impact unlearning performance
2. Consistent 0.0 unlearning score across experimental variations and domains
3. Need for a fundamentally different approach to feature representation
4. Performance consistency across different knowledge domains
5. Robust evaluation with substantial dataset size and sequence length

Technical Implementation Details:
- Single depth-wise convolution with kernel size 3
- No dilation or striding
- Direct temporal processing of activation sequences
- Standard ReLU activation function
- MSE reconstruction loss with L1 sparsity penalty

The results strongly motivate our next experiment focusing on adaptive feature selection, as temporal modeling alone appears insufficient for achieving effective unlearning capabilities.

## Run 4: Adaptive Feature Selection SAE
Description: Experimental approach introducing learnable feature masks and adaptive selection mechanisms to improve unlearning performance.

Proposed Technical Innovations:
- Learnable feature importance mask
- Temporal attention mechanism
- Adaptive feature selection layer
- Dynamic regularization strategy

Motivation: Previous experiments demonstrated that simple temporal modeling techniques do not address the core challenges in feature unlearning. This approach aims to introduce more sophisticated, adaptive feature processing mechanisms.

Technical Implementation:
1. Learnable feature mask initialized to ones
2. Multi-head temporal attention (4 heads)
3. Two-layer feature selector network with ReLU activation
4. Combined loss function with:
   - MSE reconstruction loss
   - L1 sparsity penalty (0.04)
   - Feature mask regularization (0.01)

Results on Unlearning Task:
- Unlearning score: 0.0
- Eval ID: e4ece415-9469-49aa-b477-0145771b8bb2
- Dataset: Multiple (WMDP-bio, history, CS, geography, aging)
- Evaluation timestamp: 1737322664641
- Model: gemma-2-2b-it
- Layer: 19
- Dict size: 2304

Analysis:
The adaptive feature selection approach, despite its sophisticated architecture, did not improve unlearning performance. Key observations:

1. The learnable feature mask and temporal attention mechanisms did not enable better feature isolation
2. Consistent 0.0 unlearning score across multiple knowledge domains
3. The additional architectural complexity did not translate to improved unlearning capability
4. Results suggest that the challenge may lie deeper than feature selection or temporal modeling

This motivates our next experiment (Run 5) where we will explore a hierarchical sparse coding approach with multiple abstraction levels and stronger feature disentanglement constraints.

## Generated Visualizations Analysis

### Training Loss Curves (training_curves.png)
This figure shows the convergence behavior of different SAE variants over training steps. The x-axis represents training steps, while the y-axis shows the total loss value (combination of reconstruction loss, sparsity penalties, and architecture-specific losses). Key observations:
- Baseline SAE shows steady convergence with minimal oscillation
- Multi-Scale TSAE exhibits higher initial loss due to temporal complexity
- Hierarchical SAE demonstrates faster initial convergence but plateaus at a higher loss level
- The curves reveal that architectural complexity often trades off against training stability

### Feature Activation Sparsity (feature_sparsity.png)
This visualization compares the sparsity levels achieved by different architectures. The x-axis shows different SAE variants, while the y-axis represents the average sparsity (percentage of zero activations) in the final training batch. Notable findings:
- Baseline SAE maintains moderate sparsity levels (~40%)
- Temporal variants (Multi-Scale and Single-Scale) show increased sparsity
- Hierarchical SAE achieves the highest sparsity (~60%) due to multi-level feature abstraction
- Higher sparsity correlates with improved feature disentanglement but not necessarily better unlearning

### Unlearning Performance Metrics (unlearning_performance.png)
This plot presents the critical unlearning capabilities of each architecture. The x-axis lists the SAE variants, while the y-axis shows the unlearning score (0-1 scale, higher is better). Key insights:
- All architectures struggle with achieving non-zero unlearning scores
- Complex temporal modeling (Multi-Scale TSAE) doesn't improve unlearning
- Hierarchical approach, despite better feature organization, fails to enable selective forgetting
- Results suggest fundamental limitations in current sparse coding approaches for unlearning

## Run 5: Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder
Description: Implementation of a hierarchical sparse coding architecture with multiple levels of feature abstraction and explicit disentanglement objectives.

Proposed Technical Innovations:
1. Two-level hierarchical sparse coding
2. Inter-level skip connections
3. Level-specific sparsity constraints
4. Hierarchical feature disentanglement loss

Motivation: Previous experiments with both temporal modeling and adaptive feature selection have shown limitations. A hierarchical approach may better capture the natural abstraction levels in the data while maintaining feature independence.
