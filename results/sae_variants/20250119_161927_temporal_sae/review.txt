    "Summary": "The paper proposes a hierarchical sparse autoencoder (HSAE) designed to improve feature organization and enable selective modification of language model knowledge. Despite achieving significant improvements in feature sparsity and training convergence, the method fails to achieve selective knowledge modification, as evidenced by a 0.0 score on the WMDP-bio unlearning benchmark.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The hierarchical sparse autoencoder (HSAE) architecture is novel and well-motivated.",
        "Extensive experimental evaluation, including ablation studies and cross-domain comparisons.",
        "Identifies a significant problem in AI safety and interpretability."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Fails to achieve selective knowledge modification, scoring 0.0 on the unlearning benchmark.",
        "Insufficient insights into why the method fails in selective modification tasks.",
        "Increased architectural complexity does not translate into practical benefits for the primary goal.",
        "Some methodological details, particularly regarding the autoencoder aggregator, are not sufficiently clear."
