        "Technical_Details": "The paper proposes two novel sparse autoencoder (SAE) variants: Feature Choice (FC) and Mutual Choice (MC). These allow for variable numbers of active features per token, framing the token-feature matching as a resource allocation problem with a total sparsity upper bound. The FC approach allows each feature to select m tokens to process, where m = M/F (M is total matches, F is number of features). MC combines aspects of FC and token choice. A new aux_zipf_loss is introduced to encourage feature densities to follow a Zipf distribution, mitigating feature under-utilization. The paper also suggests a phased training approach, starting with MC and transitioning to FC.",

        "Technical_Details": "BatchTopK is a novel training method for Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that replaces the sample-level TopK operation with a batch-level constraint. Instead of enforcing a fixed number of active latents per sample, BatchTopK selects the top activations across the entire batch. This allows for variable sparsity per sample, with some samples using more latents and others using fewer. The method introduces a batch dependency during training, which is addressed during inference by estimating a global threshold parameter. This threshold is calculated as the average of minimum positive activation values across multiple batches. The SAE is trained on language model activations (e.g., from the residual stream) using a large text corpus. The loss function combines L2 reconstruction error with an L0 sparsity penalty. Experiments were conducted on GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B models, using dictionary sizes of 3072, 6144, 12288, and 24576, with a bandwidth parameter of 0.001 and the Adam optimizer (learning rate 3e-4).",

This improvement in reconstruction quality, as demonstrated by lower normalized MSE and reduced cross-entropy degradation, could lead to more accurate and insightful interpretations of model behavior.

        "Abstract": "We introduce Globally Adaptive Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (GAT-SAE), combining learned global decay parameters with feature-specific variance temperature scaling. By learning three global parameters (\u03b2, \u03b8, \u03c4) that modulate all features' temporal adaptation, GAT-SAE maintains parameter efficiency while preserving feature-wise sensitivity through temperature-scaled variance estimates. This approach automatically balances consistent temporal strategy with feature-specific needs using a single temperature-adjusted variance normalization. The method targets polysemanticity through efficient yet adaptive temporal consistency, particularly benefiting sparse_probing tasks requiring robust handling of diverse feature activation patterns across hierarchical concepts.",

        "Abstract": "We introduce Dual Persistence Sparse Autoencoders (DP-SAE), employing combined active/inactive streak analysis to combat feature absorption. Our method tracks both consecutive activations and deactivations through efficient bitwise operations, applying stability penalties based on the interaction between activation bursts and subsequent inactivity periods. The core innovation lies in joint analysis of complementary persistence metrics using fused bitmask operations, enabling precise identification of absorption-prone activation patterns. Experimental evaluation focuses on correlation analysis between dual persistence metrics and absorption reduction across hierarchical concept classifications, providing comprehensive insights into temporal activation dynamics for interpretable feature learning.",
