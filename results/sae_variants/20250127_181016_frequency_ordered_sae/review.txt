    "Summary": "The paper introduces Frequency-Ordered Sparse Autoencoders (FOSAEs) to enhance interpretability in neural network representations by ordering features based on their activation frequencies. It proposes a novel frequency-based ordering constraint, adaptive L1 penalties, and a comprehensive architecture combining layer normalization, skip connections, and self-attention mechanisms. The method is validated through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2B language model, demonstrating strong performance while maintaining interpretability.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper tackles the important issue of systematic feature organization in neural networks, which is crucial for interpretability.",
        "The proposed frequency-based ordering mechanism is novel and provides a natural hierarchy for feature analysis.",
        "Extensive experimental validation, including ablation studies, provides a thorough assessment of the proposed method.",
        "The integration of adaptive penalties, layer normalization, skip connections, and self-attention mechanisms demonstrates a comprehensive approach to improving model performance while maintaining interpretability."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "The architecture is complex, which may hinder reproducibility and scalability to larger models.",
        "The computational overhead introduced by frequency tracking and other mechanisms is significant (15-20% additional computation time).",
        "The evaluation is limited to letter-specific features, which may not generalize to more complex semantic concepts.",
        "The method relies on several hyperparameters that need careful tuning, which could limit its practical applicability.",
        "The paper lacks clarity in some sections, particularly in the methodological details.",
        "Insufficient comparative analysis with existing methods beyond the mentioned baselines."
