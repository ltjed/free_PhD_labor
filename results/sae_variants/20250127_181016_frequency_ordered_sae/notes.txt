# Title: Frequency-Based Feature Ordering in Sparse Autoencoders

# Plot Analysis

## Figure: training_loss_comparison.png
This plot compares the final training loss across different model iterations. The bar chart reveals several key insights:
- Baseline and early iterations (Runs 2-3) show relatively high loss values around 200
- A notable spike in loss for Run 4 (Enhanced Resampling) reaching ~1080, indicating the initial cost of stricter constraints
- Gradual improvement in Runs 5-7 as adaptive penalties and normalization techniques were introduced
- Dramatic improvement in Run 8 (Skip Connections) achieving the lowest loss of ~85
- Slight increase but still strong performance in Run 9 (Self-Attention) at ~147

The progression shows how architectural improvements successfully reduced training loss, with skip connections providing the most significant impact.

## Figure: reconstruction_metrics.png
This plot shows two key metrics across runs:
1. KL Divergence Score: Measures how well the model preserves the original behavior
2. Cosine Similarity: Indicates reconstruction quality

Notable observations:
- Early runs (2-3) maintained stable metrics (KL ~0.795, Cosine ~0.770)
- Run 4 showed a trade-off with lower metrics due to increased sparsity
- Steady improvements through Runs 5-7 with layer normalization
- Run 8 achieved peak performance (KL: 0.990, Cosine: 0.969)
- Run 9 maintained strong performance with slight trade-offs for attention mechanism

The plot demonstrates how architectural improvements enhanced reconstruction quality while preserving model behavior.

## Figure: absorption_metrics.png
This visualization tracks two absorption-related metrics:
1. Mean Absorption Score: How well features capture specific concepts
2. Mean Split Features: Average number of features involved in concept encoding

Key findings:
- Consistent absorption score (~0.010) across all runs
- Stable feature splitting (~1.2 features) throughout iterations
- Remarkably consistent performance despite architectural changes
- Strong letter-specific performance maintained across runs
- No degradation in absorption capability with increased model complexity

The stability of these metrics across runs is unexpected and suggests that the core absorption capability is robust to architectural modifications.

## Figure: scr_threshold_comparison.png
This plot examines SCR (Sparse Coding Rate) performance across different feature thresholds (2, 5, 10, 20) for each run.

Significant patterns:
- Early runs showed inconsistent performance across thresholds
- Run 4 demonstrated more balanced but lower overall SCR scores
- Runs 5-7 showed gradual improvement in consistency
- Run 8 achieved the most stable performance across thresholds
- Run 9 introduced more nuanced patterns while maintaining stability

Unexpected findings:
- Non-linear relationship between threshold and performance
- Some runs performing better at higher thresholds (contrary to typical expectations)
- Resilience of SCR metrics to architectural complexity

## Feature Analysis Plots (per run)
Each run generates two additional plots:

1. feature_frequencies.png:
- Shows raw activation frequencies for each feature
- Reveals effectiveness of frequency ordering constraint
- Demonstrates feature utilization patterns
- Helps identify potential dead features

2. frequency_ordering.png:
- Displays features sorted by activation frequency
- Validates the success of frequency-based ordering
- Shows distribution of feature importance
- Helps assess the smoothness of feature transition

These plots were particularly valuable in:
- Confirming the effectiveness of frequency ordering
- Identifying the need for enhanced resampling (Run 4)
- Validating the impact of adaptive penalties (Run 5)
- Demonstrating the stability improvements from normalization (Run 7)

The progression of these plots across runs shows the gradual refinement of feature learning and utilization, with later runs showing more balanced and structured patterns.
