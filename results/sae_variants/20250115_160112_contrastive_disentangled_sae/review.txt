    "Summary": "The paper proposes a novel contrastive learning framework combined with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to improve the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) by disentangling features. The method addresses challenges such as memory constraints, optimization instability, and the balance between sparsity and reconstruction quality through sequence-aware positive pair generation, targeted negative sampling, and dynamic loss weighting.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses an important and timely problem in language model interpretability.",
        "Combines contrastive learning with sparse autoencoders, which is a novel approach.",
        "Provides a comprehensive experimental setup and detailed analysis of challenges."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Consistent failure to achieve stable training and effective results.",
        "Insufficient details on the autoencoder aggregator, hyperparameter choices, and architectural decisions.",
        "Poor reconstruction quality and high cross-entropy loss in experimental results.",
        "Lacks sufficient ablation studies and qualitative analyses to understand the impact of various components.",
        "Does not provide robust solutions to the identified challenges of memory constraints and optimization instability."
