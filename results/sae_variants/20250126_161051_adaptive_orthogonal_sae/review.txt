    "Summary": "The paper proposes an Adaptive Orthogonal Sparse Autoencoder (AOSAE) for disentangling features in large language models. The method introduces selective orthogonality constraints and adaptive regularization to balance feature independence and reconstruction fidelity. Experiments show promising results in terms of reconstruction, sparsity, and task performance.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The idea of combining selective orthogonality constraints with adaptive regularization is novel.",
        "The method achieves strong reconstruction fidelity and sparsity while maintaining a high percentage of the original model's performance.",
        "The approach is computationally efficient, making it scalable to large models.",
        "The method demonstrates particular strengths in bias mitigation and structured tasks like code understanding."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks a thorough comparison with stronger baselines and existing methods.",
        "Some important implementation details and ablation studies are not sufficiently explained.",
        "The clarity of the paper is suboptimal, making it hard to follow in some sections.",
        "Experiments are somewhat limited and do not cover a wide range of practical applications.",
        "The method shows sensitivity to the initial \u03c4 range, requiring careful tuning.",
        "The higher variance observed on cross-lingual tasks compared to the baseline is a concern that needs addressing.",
        "The longer training time compared to fixed-\u03c4 approaches might be a limiting factor in practical applications."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors provide more details on the implementation and the ablation studies?",

        "Could the authors conduct more ablation studies to dissect the impact of each component (e.g., adaptive constraint strength and selective orthogonality) on the performance?"

    "Limitations": [
        "The method's sensitivity to the initial \u03c4 range requires careful tuning, which might limit its ease of use.",
