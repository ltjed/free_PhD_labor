# Title: Instantaneous Top-k Orthogonality Constraints for Feature Disentanglement
# Experiment description: 1. Select top 0.1% f_i*f_j pairs per batch
2. Apply orthogonality loss to selected pairs
3. Use L2 weight normalization on W_dec
4. Compare fixed vs adaptive τ values
5. Measure absorption reduction efficiency
6. Analyze pair selection stability
7. Ablate top-k threshold impact

## Run 0: Baseline
Description: Baseline results without orthogonality constraints.

## Run 1: Fixed τ Implementation
Description: Initial implementation of orthogonality constraints with:
- Fixed τ = 0.1
- Top 0.1% most correlated feature pairs selected per batch
- L2 weight normalization on decoder weights
- Unlearning evaluation shows initial unlearning_score of 0.0, suggesting room for improvement
- Architecture successfully implemented with orthogonality constraints
- Evaluation on gemma-2b-it model layer 19 completed

Key Implementation Details:
1. Implemented select_top_pairs() to identify most correlated feature pairs
2. Added orthogonality_loss() computation
3. Integrated L2 normalization for decoder weights
4. Modified loss function to include orthogonality term

Results: Unlearning evaluation completed with initial metrics showing room for improvement. The unlearning score of 0.0 suggests that the fixed τ approach may need adjustment, leading us to Run 2's adaptive τ implementation.

Next Steps: Implement adaptive τ mechanism to dynamically adjust orthogonality constraint strength based on feature correlation distributions.

## Run 2: Adaptive τ Implementation
Description: Implementation of dynamic orthogonality constraint adjustment with:
- Initial τ = 0.1, bounds [0.01, 1.0]
- Adaptive τ based on correlation history
- Top 0.1% feature pair selection maintained
- L2 weight normalization on decoder weights

Key Implementation Details:
1. Added correlation history tracking
2. Implemented update_tau() for dynamic τ adjustment
3. Modified orthogonality_loss() to use adaptive τ
4. Maintained core architecture from Run 1

Results: Unlearning evaluation completed with unlearning_score remaining at 0.0, suggesting that:
1. The adaptive mechanism may need stronger initial constraints
2. The correlation threshold (0.1%) may be too selective
3. The τ adjustment rate may need to be more aggressive

Next Steps: Implement more aggressive orthogonality constraints with:
- Higher initial τ (0.5)
- Wider τ bounds [0.1, 2.0]
- Increased feature pair selection (top 1%)

## Run 3: Aggressive Orthogonality Implementation
Description: Implementation of more aggressive orthogonality constraints with:
- Initial τ = 0.5 (5x higher than Run 1)
- Expanded τ bounds [0.1, 2.0] for wider dynamic range
- Increased feature pair selection to top 1% (10x more pairs than Run 1/2)
- More aggressive τ adjustment rates (1.5x increase, 0.7x decrease)
- Maintained L2 weight normalization on decoder weights

Key Implementation Details:
1. Increased initial τ to 0.5 for stronger initial orthogonality enforcement
2. Widened τ bounds to allow both stronger and weaker constraints as needed
3. Increased feature pair selection to top 1% for broader coverage
4. Implemented more aggressive τ adjustment mechanism
5. Maintained core architecture from previous runs

Results: Unlearning evaluation completed with unlearning_score remaining at 0.0, suggesting that:
1. The orthogonality constraints, even with aggressive parameters, may not be sufficient
2. The approach may need fundamental architectural changes rather than parameter tuning
3. The evaluation metric may need investigation for sensitivity

Next Steps: Consider fundamental architectural changes:
- Implement global orthogonality constraints instead of pair-wise
- Add gradient projection to maintain orthogonality during training
- Investigate alternative feature selection strategies

## Run 4: Global Orthogonality Implementation
Description: Fundamental architectural change moving from pair-wise to global orthogonality constraints using SVD:
- Implemented feature normalization before correlation computation
- Added global correlation matrix calculation
- Introduced SVD-based orthogonality measurement
- Dynamic τ adjustment based on maximum correlation across all features
- Maintained L2 weight normalization on decoder weights

Key Implementation Details:
1. Replaced pair-wise feature selection with global correlation matrix
2. Added SVD computation to measure non-orthogonality across all features
3. Modified τ adjustment to use maximum correlation as signal
4. Improved numerical stability with proper feature normalization
5. Maintained core architecture elements from previous runs

Results: Unlearning evaluation completed with unlearning_score remaining at 0.0, indicating that:
1. The global orthogonality approach did not improve feature disentanglement
2. The SVD-based loss may need refinement
3. The evaluation metric's sensitivity needs investigation
4. Alternative approaches to feature disentanglement may be needed

Next Steps: Implement gradient projection approach:
- Add explicit gradient orthogonalization during training
- Maintain orthogonality through direct weight matrix manipulation
- Focus on preserving learned features while enforcing constraints

## Run 5: Gradient Projection Implementation
Description: Fundamental architectural change implementing gradient projection to maintain orthogonality during training:
- Created custom OrthogonalAdam optimizer with gradient projection
- Applied QR decomposition for gradient orthogonalization
- Implemented explicit orthogonalization of weights after updates using SVD
- Applied constraints to both encoder and decoder weights
- Maintained core feature extraction and L2 normalization

Key Implementation Details:
1. Implemented OrthogonalAdam optimizer extending torch.optim.Adam
2. Added project_gradients() method using QR decomposition
3. Implemented post-update orthogonalization using SVD
4. Applied constraints to both W_enc and W_dec
5. Maintained existing loss computation and feature extraction

Results: Unlearning evaluation completed with unlearning_score remaining at 0.0, indicating that:
1. The gradient projection approach did not improve feature disentanglement
2. The orthogonalization of both encoder and decoder weights was insufficient
3. The fundamental approach to feature disentanglement may need rethinking
4. The evaluation metric's sensitivity should be investigated

Next Steps: Consider alternative approaches:
- Investigate contrastive learning techniques
- Explore information bottleneck methods
- Consider adversarial training approaches
- Research alternative evaluation metrics

   - Baseline shows highest initial loss but stable convergence
   - Gradient Projection implementation achieves lowest final loss
   - Fixed τ and Adaptive τ show similar convergence patterns
   - Global SVD approach shows more oscillatory behavior

2. Orthogonality Loss Over Time (Top Right):
   - Measures the degree of feature disentanglement
   - Baseline has no orthogonality loss (not implemented)
   - Gradient Projection shows fastest decrease in orthogonality loss
   - Global SVD implementation shows high variance in orthogonality
   - Adaptive τ maintains more consistent orthogonality than Fixed τ

3. τ Values Over Time (Bottom Left):

   - All implementations maintain similar sparsity patterns
   - Gradient Projection shows slightly better sparsity
   - Global SVD implementation shows higher variance in sparsity
   - Baseline maintains consistent but higher sparsity loss

## final_metrics.png
This bar chart provides a comparative analysis of the final performance metrics:

1. Final Loss Values:
   - Gradient Projection achieves lowest final loss
   - Global SVD shows comparable performance to Adaptive τ
   - Baseline has highest final loss as expected

2. Final Orthogonality Loss:
   - Gradient Projection shows best feature disentanglement
   - Global SVD and Aggressive τ show similar final orthogonality
   - Fixed τ has higher final orthogonality loss
   - Baseline has no orthogonality measurement

3. Final Sparsity Loss:
   - All implementations achieve similar final sparsity
   - Gradient Projection slightly outperforms others
   - Differences in sparsity are less pronounced than other metrics

Key Observations:
- Gradient Projection consistently outperforms other approaches
- Global orthogonality constraints show promise but high variance
- Adaptive τ provides better stability than fixed approaches
- All methods maintain similar sparsity characteristics
- Unlearning scores remain at 0.0 despite improvements in other metrics

These visualizations suggest that while the implementations successfully achieve different aspects of the intended behavior (orthogonality, sparsity), they don't translate to improved unlearning performance, indicating a potential disconnect between these metrics and the ultimate goal of feature disentanglement for unlearning.
