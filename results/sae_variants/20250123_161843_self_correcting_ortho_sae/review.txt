    "Summary": "The paper proposes a novel sparse autoencoder (SAE) architecture aimed at extracting interpretable features from large language models. The approach combines multi-scale normalization, orthogonality constraints, and adaptive feature reactivation. The authors claim significant improvements in sparsity, reconstruction quality, and information preservation on the Gemma-2B language model.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical problem in neural network interpretability.",
        "Proposes a novel combination of multi-scale normalization and adaptive thresholding.",
        "Provides comprehensive experimental evaluation with detailed metrics.",
        "Includes systematic architectural iterations and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The clarity of the paper is lacking, particularly in the methodology and experimental setup sections.",
        "The practical impact is limited by the trade-offs between sparsity and behavioral preservation.",
        "There are concerns about the reproducibility and stability of the results.",
        "The autoencoder aggregator is not clearly explained.",
        "The novelty of the approach is limited, as it builds on existing methods with incremental improvements.",
        "The theoretical foundation for the proposed methods is weak, and the justification for their effectiveness is not convincingly presented.",
        "The computational overhead introduced by the attention mechanisms is significant but not adequately addressed.",
        "The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods."
