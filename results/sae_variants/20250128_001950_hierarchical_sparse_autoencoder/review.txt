    "Summary": "The paper introduces HierarchicalSAE, a novel architecture combining dynamic sparsity scheduling with feature clustering to address feature absorption in sparse autoencoders. The proposed method dynamically adjusts constraints based on reconstruction quality and maintains feature stability. Experiments on the Gemma-2-2B dataset demonstrate significant improvements in reducing feature absorption, increasing explained variance, and enhancing sparse probing accuracy while maintaining a higher number of active features compared to standard SAEs.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical problem in neural interpretability, i.e., feature absorption.",
        "Introduces dynamic sparsity scheduling and adaptive feature clustering, which are novel approaches.",

    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks detailed explanations on some key components, such as the autoencoder aggregator.",
        "Evaluation is limited to a single dataset (Gemma-2-2B), and the generalizability to other datasets or model layers is not validated.",
        "Additional ablation studies could be beneficial to better understand the contributions of each component.",
        "The clarity and organization of the paper could be improved for better readability.",
        "The experimental setup and hyperparameters are not thoroughly discussed, raising concerns about robustness and generalizability."
