# Title: Causal Sparse Autoencoders: Learning Causally Verified Features in Language Models

# Visualization Analysis

## Figure Descriptions

### 1. Loss Comparison (loss_comparison.png)
This bar plot compares the final loss values across different experimental runs. The x-axis shows the different model variants (Baseline SAE through CSAE + Gradient Penalty), while the y-axis represents the final loss value achieved by each model. Key observations:
- Baseline SAE shows highest loss, indicating room for improvement
- Progressive reduction in loss across CSAE variants
- CSAE + Gradient Penalty achieves lowest loss, suggesting effectiveness of combined approach
- Clear visualization of the impact of each architectural modification

### 2. NCES Evolution (nces_evolution.png)
This line plot tracks the Normalized Causal Effect Score (NCES) over training steps for each model variant. The x-axis represents training steps, while the y-axis shows the NCES value. Notable findings:
- Initial CSAE shows modest NCES improvements over baseline
- Increased intervention size (0.3) leads to stronger causal effects
- Contrastive loss addition creates more stable NCES progression
- Gradient penalty version maintains high NCES while improving feature independence
- Clear separation between different architectural variants in terms of causal effect strength

### 3. Feature Correlations (feature_correlations.png)
This heatmap visualizes the correlation matrix between learned features in the final CSAE + Gradient Penalty model. The color scale ranges from blue (negative correlation) through white (no correlation) to red (positive correlation). Key insights:
- Diagonal shows expected self-correlations of 1.0
- Off-diagonal elements mostly show low correlations, indicating successful feature separation
- Few clusters of moderately correlated features suggest some remaining dependencies
- Gradient penalty effectively minimizes unwanted feature correlations
- Clear improvement over earlier versions without correlation constraints

### 4. Intervention Distribution (intervention_distribution.png)
This density plot shows the distribution of intervention sizes across features for each model variant. The x-axis represents intervention size, while the y-axis shows the density. Important observations:
- Baseline shows narrow intervention distribution around initial value
- Progressive broadening of distribution with architectural improvements
- CSAE + Contrastive shows more uniform intervention distribution
- Final version with gradient penalty maintains balanced intervention sizes
- Clear evidence of adaptive intervention strategy effectiveness
