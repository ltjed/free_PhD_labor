    "Summary": "The paper introduces a novel sparse autoencoder architecture designed to achieve targeted feature separation while maintaining reconstruction quality. The key innovation is a cubic scaling mechanism that adjusts separation pressure based on feature correlations. The approach is validated on the Gemma-2-2b model, showing a reduction in reconstruction loss and maintenance of strong performance on downstream tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and relevant problem in the context of large language models and their interpretability.",
        "The introduction of cubic scaling for orthogonality penalties is novel and theoretically sound.",
        "Comprehensive experiments, including comparisons with baseline models and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The clarity of the method section is lacking, particularly in the description of the autoencoder aggregator and the progressive orthogonality mechanism.",
        "The empirical improvements, while present, are modest (3.8% reduction in reconstruction loss). The paper should discuss why this improvement is significant.",
        "Significant performance degradation in downstream tasks.",
        "The limited scope of experiments (e.g., specific to the Gemma-2-2b model) may hinder the generalizability of the findings.",
        "Fails to achieve complete knowledge isolation as indicated by the unlearning evaluation score of 0.0."

    "Questions": [
        "Can the authors provide more details on the autoencoder aggregator and how it is implemented?",
        "What is the significance of the 3.8% reduction in reconstruction loss? How does this improvement compare to other methods in the literature?",
        "Can the authors provide more comprehensive ablation studies, particularly regarding different types of aggregators and modulation functions?",
        "How does the method perform on other models beyond Gemma-2-2b?",
        "Can you provide more details and intuition behind the activation-based weighting mechanism?",
        "How does the cubic scaling mechanism compare with other potential non-linear scaling mechanisms?",
        "Can you discuss the computational overhead introduced by the proposed cubic scaling and activation-based weighting?"

    "Limitations": [
        "The paper should provide a more thorough discussion of the limitations, particularly regarding the trade-offs between feature separation and downstream task performance.",
        "The modest improvement in reconstruction loss suggests that there may be fundamental constraints in the approach. This should be discussed in more detail.",
        "The method shows significant performance degradation in downstream tasks.",
        "Fails to achieve complete knowledge isolation."
