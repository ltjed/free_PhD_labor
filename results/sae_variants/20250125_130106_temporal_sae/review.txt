    "Summary": "The paper introduces TemporalLens, a position-aware sparse autoencoder aimed at interpreting sequential neural representations in transformer models. It combines learnable position-specific feature masks with temperature-controlled annealing to capture position-specific patterns across different network layers. Experiments validate the method's effectiveness on the Gemma-2B language model, revealing systematic differences in temporal processing.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical issue in neural network interpretability, particularly for transformer models.",
        "Introduces innovative techniques such as temperature-annealed feature masks and adaptive loss weighting.",
        "Comprehensive empirical analysis demonstrating the method's effectiveness."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Dense technical details could be better explained for clarity.",
        "Requires layer-specific tuning, which may limit generalizability.",
        "Computational cost scales linearly with sequence length, potentially affecting efficiency.",
        "Limited empirical validation on different models and datasets.",
        "Lacks thorough comparison with other state-of-the-art interpretability methods.",
        "Insufficient implementation details for reproducibility."
