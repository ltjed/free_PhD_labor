    "Summary": "The paper introduces Multi-Scale Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (MTSAEs) to extract interpretable features from LLM activation sequences, balancing feature interpretability with temporal coherence via a hierarchical structure and a carefully tuned loss function. The method was validated on the Gemma-2B model across various tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses an important issue in the interpretability and modification of LLMs.",
        "Proposes a novel combination of dilated convolutions and sparse coding.",
        "Provides empirical validation showing that MTSAEs maintain model accuracy while achieving high sparsity.",
        "Includes systematic experimentation to tune the loss function and analyze model performance."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing methods for interpretability and sparsity in LLMs.",
        "The proposed method increases computational cost significantly (2.5x training time and 16x smaller batch size).",
        "Claims of interpretability are somewhat subjective, lacking rigorous qualitative analysis and user studies.",
        "Limited ablation studies on the influence of each component, especially sparse coding and temporal coherence terms.",
        "The paper needs to provide more details on the implementation and reproducibility aspects.",
        "The evaluation section lacks a thorough discussion on the limitations and potential negative societal impacts of the proposed method."

        "How does the performance of MTSAEs compare with other state-of-the-art methods for interpretability and sparsity in LLMs?",
        "Can the authors provide more detailed ablation studies on the influence of different components (e.g., sparse coding, temporal coherence)?",
        "What are the practical implications of the increased computational cost and reduced batch size?",
        "Can the authors provide more details on the implementation to ensure reproducibility?",
        "What are the potential negative societal impacts of the proposed method?"

    "Limitations": [
        "The increased computational cost and reduced batch size limit the scalability of the method.",
        "Lack of rigorous qualitative analysis to support claims of interpretability.",
