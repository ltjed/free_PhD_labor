#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: HierSAE: Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretable Feature Extraction in Language Models.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: 1. Implement two-level hierarchical SAE with coarse and fine features  
#### 2. Add soft tree structure constraints using mutual information  
#### 3. Implement progressive training curriculum (coarse->fine)  
#### 4. Create hierarchical feature visualization dashboard  
#### 5. Compare against baseline SAE using:  
####    - Feature recovery metrics  
####    - Parent-child mutual information  
####    - Downstream task performance  
####    - Human interpretability studies.  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'shakespeare_char': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.8083514968554179, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.4693279266357422, 'total_train_time_mean': 301.409769932429, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 476.76571942025066}, 'enwik8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9414697289466858, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.0054575204849243, 'total_train_time_mean': 2371.9740512371063, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 481.0998539249739}, 'text8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9939898252487183, 'best_val_loss_mean': 0.9801777005195618, 'total_train_time_mean': 2351.458997964859, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 476.5669066097941}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.
