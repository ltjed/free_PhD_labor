Auxiliary loss (AuxK) and initialization techniques to prevent dead latents\n3. Training methodology scaled up to 16M latent dimensions on GPT-4\n4. Multiple evaluation metrics including:\n   - Downstream loss\n   - Feature probe recovery\n   - N2G explanations for interpretability\n   - Ablation sparsity measures\n5. Systematic study of scaling relationships between:\n   - Number of latents (n)\n   - Sparsity level (k)\n   - Model size\n   - Compute budget\n6. Analysis of progressive feature recovery and activation patterns",

        "Experiment": "Implementation steps:\n1. Implement two-level sparse autoencoder architecture:\n   - Level 1: High-dimensional, low sparsity for basic features\n   - Level 2: Lower-dimensional, higher sparsity for abstract features\n2. Add residual connections between levels\n3. Design loss function with three components:\n   - Reconstruction loss for each level\n   - Contrastive loss between levels to encourage separation\n   - Sparsity constraints (different k per level)\n4. Implement curriculum training:\n   - Train Level 1 to convergence\n   - Freeze Level 1 and train Level 2\n5. Evaluate using:\n   - Feature-level mutual information\n   - Inter-level feature overlap metrics\n   - Level-specific probing tasks\n   - Causal intervention studies\n6. Compare against baseline single-level autoencoder\n7. Analyze feature hierarchy through case studies",
