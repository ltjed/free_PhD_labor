Auxiliary loss (AuxK) and initialization techniques to prevent dead latents\n3. Training methodology scaled up to 16M latent dimensions on GPT-4\n4. Multiple evaluation metrics including:\n   - Downstream loss\n   - Feature probe recovery\n   - N2G explanations for interpretability\n   - Ablation sparsity measures\n5. Systematic study of scaling relationships between:\n   - Number of latents (n)\n   - Sparsity level (k)\n   - Model size\n   - Compute budget\n6. Analysis of progressive feature recovery and activation patterns",
