#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoders for Multi-Level Interpretability of Language Model Representations.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: 1. Implement 2-layer hierarchical autoencoder:  
####    - Bottom layer: 90% sparsity, focus on basic features  
####    - Top layer: 70% sparsity, focus on abstract features  
####    - Skip connections with gating mechanism  
#### 2. Training protocol:  
####    - Phase 1: Train bottom layer with L1 penalty  
####    - Phase 2: Fix bottom layer, train top layer  
####    - Phase 3: End-to-end fine-tuning  
#### 3. Loss components:  
####    - Layer-specific L1 penalties  
####    - Orthogonality constraint between layers  
####    - Mutual information minimization  
#### 4. Evaluation metrics:  
####    - Feature activation correlation analysis  
####    - Semantic level assessment via NLP probing  
####    - Compression efficiency  
####    - Ablation studies per layer  
#### 5. Comparison with single-layer baseline.  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'shakespeare_char': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.8083514968554179, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.4693279266357422, 'total_train_time_mean': 301.409769932429, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 476.76571942025066}, 'enwik8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9414697289466858, 'best_val_loss_mean': 1.0054575204849243, 'total_train_time_mean': 2371.9740512371063, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 481.0998539249739}, 'text8': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.9939898252487183, 'best_val_loss_mean': 0.9801777005195618, 'total_train_time_mean': 2351.458997964859, 'avg_inference_tokens_per_second_mean': 476.5669066097941}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.
