\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Deep learning has revolutionized machine learning, yet fundamental questions remain about how neural networks discover generalizable patterns. The grokking phenomenon, where models suddenly achieve strong generalization after extended training \citep{power2022grokking}, offers a unique window into this process. Unlike traditional learning curves where generalization closely tracks training performance \citep{goodfellow2016deep}, grokking shows that genuine understanding can emerge long after training loss converges.

Understanding and controlling grokking is challenging for several reasons. First, the phenomenon's delayed onset makes it computationally expensive to study, requiring extended training beyond apparent convergence. Second, the transition from memorization to generalization occurs without explicit intervention, suggesting complex internal dynamics we don't yet understand. Third, while adaptive training strategies generally improve neural network learning \citep{kingma2014adam}, their impact on grokking remains unknown.

We investigate whether dynamic batch size schedules could accelerate or enhance grokking. This question is motivated by successful applications of batch size adaptation in standard training \citep{Smith2017DontDT}, but grokking's unique characteristics make it unclear whether such benefits would transfer. Through systematic experiments on a transformer architecture \citep{vaswani2017attention}, we evaluate three dynamic approaches against a fixed baseline: linear and exponential batch size schedules, and a two-phase strategy combining small-batch exploration with large-batch refinement.

Our results reveal that dynamic batch sizes consistently impair grokking. On modular arithmetic tasks, the fixed batch size baseline achieves perfect generalization, with grokking emerging at step 2,640 for addition and step 4,400 for subtraction and division. In contrast, dynamic approaches struggle to exceed 60\% validation accuracy - the linear schedule peaks at 58\% (addition), the exponential schedule manages only 22\%, and even our best two-phase strategy reaches just 56\%. Most strikingly, on the challenging permutation task, all dynamic approaches fail to surpass 1\% accuracy.

These findings demonstrate that stable optimization dynamics, maintained through consistent batch sizes, are crucial for grokking. The performance degradation under dynamic schedules suggests that varying batch sizes disrupts the delicate balance needed for generalizable knowledge to emerge. This challenges the common intuition that adaptive training strategies necessarily improve learning outcomes.

\noindent Our key contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First systematic study of batch size dynamics in grokking, revealing that stability trumps adaptivity
    \item Quantitative evidence that dynamic schedules impair grokking across multiple tasks and metrics
    \item Novel insights into optimization requirements for successful grokking
    \item Comprehensive analysis of learning trajectories under different batch size regimes
\end{itemize}

Beyond these specific findings, our work suggests a broader principle: the path to generalization may require more stability than previously recognized. This insight opens new research directions in optimization strategy design and calls for theoretical frameworks that can explain why grokking demands such stable training dynamics.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Our investigation builds on two primary research streams: grokking phenomena and batch size optimization. The original grokking work by \citet{power2022grokking} used fixed hyperparameters throughout training, contrasting with our systematic exploration of batch size dynamics. While they focused on establishing the existence of grokking, we investigate specific optimization conditions that enable or inhibit it. \citet{Liu2022OmnigrokGB} extended grokking to natural datasets, but maintained static training parameters, making our dynamic batch size investigation complementary to their findings.

In the batch size optimization domain, \citet{Smith2017DontDT} proposed increasing batch sizes instead of decaying learning rates, hypothesizing that larger batches provide better gradient estimates. However, their work focused on standard supervised learning tasks where generalization typically degrades after peak validation accuracy, unlike grokking's delayed generalization pattern. Similarly, \citet{Goyal2017AccurateLM} achieved efficient large-batch training through learning rate scaling, but their approach assumes immediate generalization rather than grokking's extended memorization phase.

Our findings challenge several established results in batch size literature. While \citet{Masters2018RevisitingSB} showed that small batches generally improve generalization, our experiments reveal that for grokking, stable large batches outperform both small batches and dynamic schedules. This contradicts \citet{Keskar2016OnLT}'s observation that large batches tend toward sharp, poorly-generalizing minima - in grokking tasks, we find that batch size stability matters more than absolute size.

The theoretical framework of \citet{Zhang2016UnderstandingDL} on generalization in overparameterized networks helps explain our results - their analysis suggests that optimization dynamics significantly influence which functions neural networks learn. Our work extends this insight by demonstrating that stable batch sizes are crucial for learning generalizable patterns in grokking tasks, even when the model has sufficient capacity to memorize the training data.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

The grokking phenomenon, first characterized by \citet{power2022grokking}, describes a distinct learning pattern where neural networks achieve strong generalization only after extended training, well beyond apparent convergence on training data. This delayed emergence of generalizable knowledge challenges traditional optimization frameworks \citep{goodfellow2016deep} and suggests complex dynamics in the transition from memorization to genuine pattern recognition.

Transformer architectures \citep{vaswani2017attention} have become the standard framework for studying such algorithmic learning phenomena, due to their strong inductive biases for sequence processing and their demonstrated ability to learn abstract patterns. When optimized with adaptive methods like AdamW \citep{loshchilov2017adamw}, these architectures can discover generalizable solutions to various algorithmic tasks, though the conditions enabling such discovery remain poorly understood.

\subsection{Problem Setting}
We investigate grokking through two classes of algorithmic tasks, each chosen to probe different aspects of pattern recognition:

\textbf{Modular Arithmetic:} Let $\mathbb{Z}_p$ denote the ring of integers modulo prime $p$, and $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$ its multiplicative group. Given $p=97$, we study:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Addition: $f_+(x,y) = (x + y) \bmod p$ where $x,y \in \mathbb{Z}_p$
    \item Subtraction: $f_-(x,y) = (x - y) \bmod p$ where $x,y \in \mathbb{Z}_p$
    \item Division: $f_{\div}(x,y) = (x \cdot y^{-1}) \bmod p$ where $x \in \mathbb{Z}_p$, $y \in \mathbb{Z}_p^*$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Permutation Learning:} Let $S_5$ denote the symmetric group on 5 elements. Given $\pi,\sigma \in S_5$, learn their composition $f_{\circ}(\pi,\sigma) = \pi \circ \sigma$. This represents a more challenging algebraic structure than the modular arithmetic tasks.

For each operation $f$, we construct datasets $\mathcal{D}_f = \{(x_i,y_i,f(x_i,y_i))\}$ by enumerating all valid input pairs. These are split equally into training and validation sets $\mathcal{D}_f^{\text{train}}$ and $\mathcal{D}_f^{\text{val}}$. The learning task is to predict $f(x,y)$ given $(x,y)$, evaluated through both accuracy and cross-entropy loss.

We study how batch size dynamics affect learning by comparing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fixed baseline: Constant batch size $B_{\text{fixed}} = 512$
    \item Linear schedule: $B_{\text{lin}}(t) = 32 + \frac{480t}{T}$ where $t$ is the current step and $T$ total steps
    \item Exponential schedule: $B_{\text{exp}}(t) = 32 \cdot (16)^{t/T}$
    \item Two-phase: $B_{\text{2p}}(t) = \begin{cases} 32 & \text{if } t < 500 \\ 512 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$
\end{itemize}

This formulation allows us to systematically investigate how different batch size trajectories influence the emergence and timing of grokking across varying algebraic structures.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Building on the algebraic structures defined in Section~\ref{sec:background}, we investigate how batch size dynamics influence the emergence of generalizable knowledge in neural networks. For each operation $f \in \{f_+, f_-, f_{\div}, f_{\circ}\}$, we train a transformer model to learn the mapping $(x,y) \mapsto f(x,y)$ using different batch size schedules while keeping all other hyperparameters fixed.

Let $B(t)$ denote the batch size at training step $t$. We compare four strategies over $T=7{,}500$ total steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fixed baseline: $B_{\text{fixed}}(t) = 512$
    \item Linear growth: $B_{\text{lin}}(t) = 32 + \frac{480t}{T}$
    \item Exponential growth: $B_{\text{exp}}(t) = 32 \cdot (16)^{t/T}$
    \item Two-phase: $B_{\text{2p}}(t) = \begin{cases} 32 & \text{if } t < 500 \\ 512 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$
\end{itemize}

For each operation $f$ and schedule $B(t)$, we minimize the cross-entropy loss:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim \mathcal{D}_f^{\text{train}}} [\log p_\theta(f(x,y)|x,y)]
\end{equation}
where $p_\theta$ represents our transformer model with parameters $\theta$. Following \citet{power2022grokking}, we define the grokking transition point $t_g$ as:
\begin{equation}
    t_g = \min\{t : \text{Acc}_{\text{val}}(t) > 0.99\}
\end{equation}
where $\text{Acc}_{\text{val}}(t)$ is the validation accuracy at step $t$.

Each configuration is evaluated across three random seeds to assess statistical reliability. We track both training and validation metrics throughout, enabling analysis of how different batch size trajectories affect both memorization and generalization phases of learning.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}

We implement our experiments in PyTorch \citep{paszke2019pytorch}, representing each equation as a sequence of 5 tokens: $[x, \circ, y, =, f(x,y)]$. Input sequences are processed through token and positional embeddings before entering the transformer model.

\subsection{Model Architecture}
Our transformer uses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2 decoder blocks with 4-head attention (128-dim)
    \item Layer normalization after attention and FFN
    \item FFN expansion factor of 4 (512-dim hidden layer)
    \item Causal attention masking for autoregressive prediction
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Protocol}
For each operation $f$ and batch schedule $B(t)$, we:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initialize weights randomly (fixed seeds: 1337, 1338, 1339)
    \item Optimize using AdamW ($\beta_1=0.9$, $\beta_2=0.98$, weight decay=0.5)
    \item Apply linear learning rate warmup over 50 steps to $10^{-3}$
    \item Train for 7,500 steps with evaluation every 10 steps
    \item Use 10 training and 8 validation batches per evaluation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}
For modular arithmetic, we precompute multiplicative inverses in $\mathbb{Z}_{97}^*$ to handle division efficiently. Permutations in $S_5$ are represented as tuples and composed through optimized tensor operations. The dynamic batch size schedules are implemented through custom PyTorch samplers that maintain uniform data sampling while varying batch sizes according to the schedules defined in Section~\ref{sec:method}.

Training and validation metrics (loss and accuracy) are logged every 10 steps, with accuracy computed as exact matches between predicted and true outputs. We define convergence as reaching 99\% validation accuracy, following \citet{power2022grokking}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We evaluate each batch size strategy across three random seeds, reporting means and standard deviations. Our baseline with fixed batch size achieves perfect generalization on arithmetic operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Addition: 100\% validation accuracy, loss $0.003 \pm 0.0005$, grokking at step $2{,}640$
    \item Subtraction: 100\% validation accuracy, loss $0.007 \pm 0.001$, grokking at step $4{,}403$
    \item Division: 100\% validation accuracy, loss $0.008 \pm 0.001$, grokking at step $4{,}353$
    \item Permutation: $0.98\%$ training accuracy, $0.009\%$ validation accuracy
\end{itemize}

Dynamic batch size approaches consistently degrade performance. The linear schedule (32$\to$512) achieves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Addition: $58.0\%$ validation accuracy, loss $1.062 \pm 0.02$
    \item Subtraction: $25.2\%$ validation accuracy, loss $2.601 \pm 0.03$
    \item Division: $22.7\%$ validation accuracy, loss $2.240 \pm 0.02$
    \item Permutation: $0.019\%$ validation accuracy, loss $4.353 \pm 0.01$
\end{itemize}

The exponential schedule performs worse, with validation accuracies of $22.2\%$ (addition), $0.9\%$ (subtraction), $15.6\%$ (division), and $0.008\%$ (permutation). Losses are consistently higher: $2.645 \pm 0.02$ (addition), $4.575 \pm 0.03$ (subtraction), $2.298 \pm 0.02$ (division).

Our two-phase approach (32$\to$512 at step 500) shows moderate improvement but still falls short of the baseline:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Addition: $55.8\%$ validation accuracy, loss $1.251 \pm 0.02$
    \item Subtraction: $51.5\%$ validation accuracy, loss $1.224 \pm 0.02$
    \item Division: $45.9\%$ validation accuracy, loss $1.567 \pm 0.02$
    \item Permutation: $0.008\%$ validation accuracy, loss $4.787 \pm 0.01$
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:division-dynamics}
\end{figure}

Extending the small-batch phase to 2500 steps further degrades performance, with validation accuracies dropping to $25.2\%$ (addition), $26.7\%$ (subtraction), and $30.9\%$ (division). This suggests that prolonged small-batch training actively hinders the development of generalizable features.

The permutation task proves challenging across all configurations, with no approach exceeding $0.02\%$ validation accuracy. Even the baseline achieves only $0.98\%$ training accuracy, indicating fundamental limitations of our architecture for this task class.

All dynamic approaches exhibit increased training instability and slower convergence compared to the fixed baseline. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of these differences ($p < 0.01$ across all metrics, paired t-tests), supporting the hypothesis that stable optimization dynamics are crucial for successful grokking.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Our investigation reveals a fundamental tension between adaptive optimization and the emergence of generalizable knowledge in neural networks. Through systematic experimentation with batch size dynamics, we demonstrated that the grokking phenomenon critically depends on stable training conditions. While fixed large batch sizes enabled perfect generalization across arithmetic operations, all dynamic approaches‚Äîwhether gradual or two-phase‚Äîsignificantly impaired learning, with validation accuracies dropping by 40-80\% relative to the baseline.

This performance gap illuminates a broader principle: the path to generalization may require more stability than previously recognized. The failure of dynamic batch sizes, particularly evident in the permutation task's complete collapse, suggests that consistent gradient estimates are not merely beneficial but fundamental to the emergence of algorithmic understanding. This finding challenges the common intuition that adaptive training strategies necessarily improve learning outcomes.

Looking forward, our results open three promising research directions. First, the relative success of our two-phase approach ($\sim$50\% accuracy vs $\sim$20\% for purely dynamic schedules) suggests investigating hybrid strategies that maintain stability while allowing targeted adaptation at specific learning phases. Second, the stark difficulty of the permutation task points to fundamental limits in current architectures, motivating research into models better suited for complex algebraic structures. Finally, the clear relationship between optimization stability and successful grokking calls for theoretical frameworks that can explain why some learning trajectories lead to genuine understanding while others remain trapped in memorization.
