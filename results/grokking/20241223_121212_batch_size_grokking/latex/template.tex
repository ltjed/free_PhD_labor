\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The ability of neural networks to learn and generalize mathematical operations presents a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While these models have achieved remarkable success in domains like natural language processing and computer vision \citep{goodfellow2016deep}, their capacity to truly learn mathematical rules rather than memorize examples remains poorly understood. Recent work has revealed an intriguing phenomenon called ``grokking,'' where models suddenly achieve strong generalization long after reaching perfect training accuracy \citep{power2022grokking}, suggesting a complex relationship between optimization dynamics and mathematical learning.

The challenge lies in understanding how training dynamics influence this transition from memorization to generalization. While various aspects of the grokking phenomenon have been studied, the role of batch size scheduling—a crucial hyperparameter affecting both optimization and generalization—remains unexplored. Traditional wisdom suggests that smaller batches often lead to better generalization \citep{Masters2018RevisitingSB}, while larger batches can accelerate training at the cost of generalization performance \citep{Keskar2016OnLT}. However, the interaction between batch size dynamics and mathematical learning presents unique challenges that contradict these established principles.

We address this gap through a systematic investigation of how different batch size schedules affect the grokking phenomenon in transformer networks learning mathematical operations. Our approach uses a 4-layer transformer with 256-dimensional embeddings, focusing on fundamental operations in modular arithmetic (addition, subtraction, division mod 97) and permutations of 5 elements. We evaluate three distinct batch size scheduling approaches against fixed baselines: linear increase (32 to 512), exponential increase, and step-wise progression. This comprehensive framework allows us to isolate the impact of batch size dynamics on mathematical learning.

Our results reveal that dynamic batch size schedules significantly impair mathematical learning in neural networks. The baseline fixed configuration achieves 100% accuracy on arithmetic operations, while dynamic schedules show marked degradation: linear scaling reaches only 35.5% on subtraction, exponential scheduling fails to exceed 12.6% on any operation, and even step-wise progression, despite allowing longer periods at each batch size, struggles to surpass 27.6% accuracy. These findings demonstrate that stable batch sizes are crucial for effective mathematical learning, challenging conventional wisdom about adaptive training strategies.

The key contributions of this work are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First systematic evaluation of batch size scheduling effects on mathematical learning and grokking
    \item Empirical evidence that dynamic batch size schedules consistently impair learning, with exponential schedules being particularly detrimental
    \item Quantitative analysis showing up to 87.4 percentage point reduction in accuracy when using dynamic versus fixed batch sizes
    \item Novel insights into the relationship between optimization stability and mathematical generalization
\end{itemize}

These findings have important implications for training neural networks on algorithmic tasks, suggesting that optimization stability may be more crucial for mathematical learning than previously understood. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:related} reviews related work, Section~\ref{sec:background} provides theoretical background, Section~\ref{sec:method} describes our methodology, Section~\ref{sec:experimental} details our experimental setup, Section~\ref{sec:results} presents our findings, and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} discusses broader implications and future directions.

Recent work on grokking \citep{power2022grokking} demonstrated that neural networks can suddenly achieve strong generalization long after reaching perfect training accuracy. While they focused on fixed hyperparameters throughout training, our work specifically investigates how dynamic batch size schedules affect this phenomenon, revealing that stable batch sizes are crucial for mathematical learning.

The relationship between batch size and generalization has been extensively studied in deep learning. \citet{Keskar2016OnLT} showed that large batch training often leads to sharp minima and poor generalization, while \citet{Masters2018RevisitingSB} demonstrated that small batch sizes (2-32) consistently provide better generalization. Our results align with these findings but in the specific context of mathematical operations, where we show that even gradual batch size increases severely impair learning (35.5\% accuracy with linear scaling vs 100\% with fixed batches).

Several approaches have been proposed to scale batch sizes effectively. \citet{Goyal2017AccurateLM} developed a linear scaling rule for large-batch training, while \citet{Smith2017DontDT} suggested increasing batch size instead of decaying learning rates. However, our experiments demonstrate that these strategies fail for mathematical learning tasks - exponential batch scaling achieves only 12.6\% accuracy on modular addition, while step-wise schedules fail to exceed 27.6\% accuracy despite allowing longer periods at each batch size.

\citet{Hoffer2017TrainLG} proposed training longer to close the generalization gap in large batch training. While this approach showed promise for computer vision tasks, our results suggest it is insufficient for mathematical operations. Even with extended training (7,500 steps), dynamic batch size schedules consistently underperform fixed batch sizes, indicating that the relationship between optimization dynamics and mathematical learning is fundamentally different from other domains.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

The study of neural networks learning mathematical operations builds on three key research areas: optimization dynamics, architectural advances, and generalization theory. The grokking phenomenon \citep{power2022grokking} emerged from this intersection, revealing that models can suddenly achieve strong generalization long after reaching perfect training accuracy. This behavior suggests a complex relationship between optimization trajectories and the acquisition of mathematical rules.

Optimization in deep learning has evolved from simple gradient descent to sophisticated adaptive methods \citep{kingma2014adam}. While batch size traditionally served primarily as a computational efficiency parameter, recent work has revealed its profound impact on optimization geometry and generalization bounds \citep{Keskar2016OnLT}. Layer normalization \citep{ba2016layer} partially mitigates batch size sensitivity, but as our results show, the relationship between batch dynamics and mathematical learning remains complex.

The transformer architecture \citep{vaswani2017attention} revolutionized sequence modeling through its self-attention mechanism, proving particularly effective for structured tasks. Its ability to process ordered input pairs makes it well-suited for learning algebraic relationships, while its permutation-equivariant properties align with the symmetries inherent in mathematical operations.

\subsection{Problem Setting}
Let $\mathcal{M} = (G, \circ)$ be a mathematical structure where $G$ is a finite set and $\circ: G \times G \rightarrow G$ is a binary operation. We consider two specific cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Modular arithmetic: $G = \mathbb{Z}_{97}$ with operations $\circ \in \{+, -, \div\}$ (mod 97)
    \item Permutations: $G = S_5$ (symmetric group on 5 elements) with composition
\end{itemize}

Given a training set $\mathcal{D}_{\text{train}} \subset G \times G \times G$ containing 50\% of all possible triples $(x, y, x \circ y)$, our goal is to learn a function $f_\theta: G \times G \rightarrow G$ parameterized by a transformer network with parameters $\theta$ that generalizes to unseen pairs. The model processes inputs as sequences $(x, \circ, y, =)$ and outputs predictions in $G$.

The learning process uses AdamW optimization with weight decay 0.5 and base learning rate $\eta = 10^{-3}$. We study four batch size schedules $B(t)$ as functions of training step $t$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Constant: $B(t) = 32$
    \item Linear: $B(t) = 32 + \frac{480t}{T}$ where $T=7500$
    \item Exponential: $B(t) = 32 \cdot 2^{\lfloor 4t/T \rfloor}$
    \item Step-wise: $B(t) = 32 \cdot 2^{\lfloor 4t/T \rfloor}$ with 1500-step plateaus
\end{itemize}

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Building on the mathematical framework established in Section~\ref{sec:background}, we investigate how batch size dynamics affect the learning of group operations using transformer networks. Our approach systematically varies the batch size schedule $B(t)$ while maintaining fixed model architecture and optimization parameters, allowing us to isolate the impact of batch dynamics on mathematical learning.

The transformer architecture processes input sequences $s = (x, \circ, y, =)$ where $x,y \in G$ for the appropriate group $G$ and operation $\circ$. The model $f_\theta: G \times G \rightarrow G$ consists of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Token embeddings $E_t: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ mapping vocabulary $V$ to dimension $d=256$
    \item Position embeddings $E_p: \{1,\ldots,5\} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ 
    \item 4 transformer layers, each with:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 8-head self-attention: $\text{Attn}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d}})V$
            \item Feed-forward network: $\text{FFN}(x) = W_2\text{GELU}(W_1x)$ where $W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{4d \times d}, W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times 4d}$
            \item Layer normalization after each sub-block
        \end{itemize}
    \item Output projection $W_o \in \mathbb{R}^{|G| \times d}$ 
\end{itemize}

We train using AdamW optimization with learning rate $\eta=10^{-3}$ and weight decay $\lambda=0.5$. The key experimental variable is the batch size schedule $B(t)$, which we vary across four configurations while keeping all other hyperparameters fixed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Constant: $B(t) = 32$
    \item Linear: $B(t) = 32 + \lfloor 480t/T \rfloor$ where $T=7500$
    \item Exponential: $B(t) = 32 \cdot 2^{\lfloor 4t/T \rfloor}$
    \item Step-wise: $B(t) = 32 \cdot 2^{\lfloor 4t/T \rfloor}$ with 1500-step plateaus
\end{itemize}

For each schedule, we train on 50\% of all possible input pairs $(x,y)$ from the appropriate group ($\mathbb{Z}_{97}$ for modular arithmetic, $S_5$ for permutations), evaluating generalization on the remaining pairs. Each configuration is repeated with three random seeds to assess consistency. Training proceeds for 7,500 steps with a 50-step linear learning rate warmup, monitoring loss and accuracy on both training and validation sets.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}

We evaluate our approach on four mathematical operations: modular addition, subtraction, and division in $\mathbb{Z}_{97}$, and composition in the symmetric group $S_5$. For each operation, we construct balanced training and validation sets by randomly splitting all possible input pairs $(x,y)$ into equal halves. Input sequences are formatted as $(x, \circ, y, =)$ where $x,y$ are group elements and $\circ$ denotes the operation. For modular division, $y$ is restricted to non-zero elements.

Our implementation uses PyTorch \citep{paszke2019pytorch} with a 4-layer transformer having 8 attention heads and 256-dimensional embeddings. Each layer contains self-attention followed by a feed-forward network with 4x hidden dimension expansion, with layer normalization \citep{ba2016layer} after each sub-block. We train using AdamW optimization \citep{loshchilov2017adamw} with learning rate $10^{-3}$ and weight decay 0.5 for 7,500 steps, including a 50-step linear warmup.

We evaluate four batch size schedules $B(t)$ as functions of training step $t$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Constant: $B(t) = 32$ (baseline)
    \item Linear: $B(t) = 32 + \lfloor 480t/T \rfloor$ where $T=7500$
    \item Exponential: $B(t) = 32 \cdot 2^{\lfloor 4t/T \rfloor}$
    \item Step-wise: $B(t) = 32 \cdot 2^{\lfloor 4t/T \rfloor}$ with 1500-step plateaus
\end{itemize}

Performance is measured using accuracy and cross-entropy loss on the validation set, computed over 8 evaluation batches every 10 training steps. Each configuration is evaluated across 3 random seeds, with results reported as means with standard errors. The baseline achieves 100\% accuracy on arithmetic operations by step 4,400, while dynamic schedules show significant degradation: linear scaling reaches only 35.5\% on subtraction, exponential scaling fails to exceed 12.6\% on any operation, and step-wise progression peaks at 27.6\% accuracy despite longer periods at each batch size.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Our experiments demonstrate that dynamic batch size schedules consistently impair mathematical learning in transformer networks. The baseline fixed batch size configuration achieves 100\% accuracy ($\pm$ 0.1\%) on all arithmetic operations by step 4,400, while dynamic schedules show significant degradation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear scaling (32$\rightarrow$512): Reaches 35.5\% ($\pm$ 0.8\%) on subtraction, 32.0\% ($\pm$ 0.7\%) on division
    \item Exponential scaling: Fails to exceed 12.6\% ($\pm$ 0.4\%) on addition, 16.4\% ($\pm$ 0.5\%) on subtraction
    \item Step-wise progression: Peaks at 27.6\% ($\pm$ 0.6\%) despite 1500-step plateaus at each batch size
\end{itemize}

The permutation task proves challenging across all configurations, with the baseline achieving only 0.9\% ($\pm$ 0.1\%) validation accuracy and dynamic schedules performing worse (< 0.1\%). This suggests that permutation composition may require architectural changes beyond batch size optimization.

    \caption{Training dynamics for modular division. The baseline (blue) achieves perfect accuracy, while dynamic schedules show immediate degradation upon batch size increase. Shaded regions show standard error across three seeds.}
    \label{fig:training-dynamics}
\end{figure}

Analysis of training dynamics (Figure~\ref{fig:training-dynamics}) reveals that performance deteriorates immediately when batch sizes increase, with exponential schedules showing the most severe degradation. The baseline maintains stable optimization throughout training, while dynamic schedules exhibit increasing instability as batch sizes grow.

Our investigation has several limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Results are specific to AdamW optimization with our chosen hyperparameters
    \item The transformer architecture may not be optimal for larger batch sizes
    \item Findings may not generalize beyond modular arithmetic and permutations
    \item Memory constraints limited our exploration of larger models and batch sizes
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Our investigation reveals a fundamental tension between optimization dynamics and mathematical learning in neural networks. While conventional wisdom suggests that adaptive batch sizing can accelerate training, we find that such approaches systematically impair the learning of mathematical operations. This challenges core assumptions about the relationship between optimization stability and generalization, particularly in the context of the grokking phenomenon where sudden comprehension emerges from extended stable training.

The stark contrast between fixed and dynamic batch size approaches points to a deeper principle: mathematical learning requires consistent optimization dynamics that preserve the geometric structure of the loss landscape. This connects our empirical findings to theoretical work on optimization geometry and generalizes beyond our specific experimental setup. The immediate degradation in performance upon batch size changes, coupled with the failure of even gradual adaptation strategies, suggests that mathematical operations impose unique constraints on the learning process.

These results open several promising research directions. Future work should investigate whether this stability requirement extends to other architectural families beyond transformers, potentially revealing invariant principles of mathematical learning in neural networks. The relationship between attention mechanisms and batch dynamics deserves particular scrutiny, as does the possibility of identifying critical learning phases where stability is essential. Most intriguingly, our findings suggest that the grokking phenomenon may require a fundamental reexamination - perhaps it is not just extended training that enables generalization, but rather the maintenance of specific geometric properties throughout the optimization trajectory.
