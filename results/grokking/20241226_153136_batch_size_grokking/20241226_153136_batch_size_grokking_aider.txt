#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Batch Size Grokking: Assessing the impact of the training batchsize on the grokking phenomenon.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Modify the experiments to dynamically adjust the batch size during training, starting with a small batch size and gradually increasing it. This could potentially lead to faster generalization on the validation set..  
#### You are given a total of up to 5 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 5.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.  
####   
#### Note that we already provide the vanilla baseline results, so you do not need to re-run it.  
####   
#### For reference, the baseline results are as follows:  
####   
#### {'x_div_y': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.0071290188158551855, 'final_val_loss_mean': 0.008281217887997627, 'final_train_acc_mean': 1.0, 'final_val_acc_mean': 1.0, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 4353.333333333333}, 'x_minus_y': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.006014337918410699, 'final_val_loss_mean': 0.007335097063332796, 'final_train_acc_mean': 1.0, 'final_val_acc_mean': 1.0, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 4403.333333333333}, 'x_plus_y': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.0029467708275963864, 'final_val_loss_mean': 0.003054410684853792, 'final_train_acc_mean': 1.0, 'final_val_acc_mean': 1.0, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 2640.0}, 'permutation': {'final_train_loss_mean': 0.12446165302147467, 'final_val_loss_mean': 8.616557439168295, 'final_train_acc_mean': 0.9800130526224772, 'final_val_acc_mean': 0.009114583333333334, 'step_val_acc_99_mean': 7500.0}}  
####   
#### After you complete each change, we will run the command `python experiment.py --out_dir=run_i' where i is the run number and evaluate the results.  
#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

I'll plan a series of experiments to test dynamic batch size adjustment during training. Here's my proposed plan:

Run 1: Linear batch size increase
- Start with batch_size=32
- Linearly increase to batch_size=512 over training
- This provides a smooth transition from small to large batches

Run 2: Exponential batch size increase 
- Start with batch_size=32
- Exponentially increase to batch_size=512 over training
- This provides faster early increases but slower later changes

Run 3: Step-wise batch size increase
- Start with batch_size=32
- Double the batch size every 1500 steps until reaching 512
- This provides discrete jumps in batch size

Let's implement Run 1 first. We need to modify experiment.py to:
1. Add batch size scheduling
2. Update the get_data function to accept initial batch size
3. Modify the training loop to update batch size

Here are the changes:

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def get_data(operation: str, prime: int, training_fraction: float, batch_size: int):
    dataset = operation_mod_p_data(operation, prime, training_fraction)
    train_dataset = GroupDataset(dataset, "train")
    val_dataset = GroupDataset(dataset, "val")
    train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size)
    val_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=batch_size)
=======
def get_data(operation: str, prime: int, training_fraction: float, batch_size: int, val_batch_size: int = None):
    if val_batch_size is None:
        val_batch_size = batch_size
    dataset = operation_mod_p_data(operation, prime, training_fraction)
    train_dataset = GroupDataset(dataset, "train")
    val_dataset = GroupDataset(dataset, "val")
    train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size)
    val_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=val_batch_size)

    def get_batch_size(step, total_steps):
        # Linear increase from 32 to 512
        min_batch = 32
        max_batch = 512
        batch_size = min_batch + (max_batch - min_batch) * (step / total_steps)
        return int(batch_size)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

experiment.py
```python

    train_loader, val_loader, n_vocab, n_output = get_data(
        operation=dataset,
        prime=97,
        training_fraction=0.5,
        batch_size=512,
    )
=======
    # Initial data loaders with minimum batch size
    train_loader, val_loader, n_vocab, n_output = get_data(
        operation=dataset,
        prime=97,
        training_fraction=0.5,
        batch_size=32,
        val_batch_size=512,
    )

experiment.py

    for ep in range(num_total_updates // num_train_batches):

    for ep in range(num_total_updates // num_train_batches):
        # Update batch size
        current_step = (ep + 1) * num_train_batches
        new_batch_size = get_batch_size(current_step, num_total_updates)
        train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
            train_loader.dataset, 
            batch_size=new_batch_size
        )

Let's run this first experiment with:

```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```

After we see the results, we can implement Run 2 or Run 3 based on how this performs.
