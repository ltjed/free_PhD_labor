\begin{abstract}
Understanding why neural networks suddenly achieve generalization long after perfect training accuracy---a phenomenon known as ``grokking''---remains a fundamental challenge in deep learning. While prior work has demonstrated grokking in various settings, the architectural factors enabling this behavior are poorly understood, limiting our ability to reliably design models that can achieve sudden generalization. We address this challenge through a systematic empirical study of transformer architectures on arithmetic and permutation tasks, controlling for total parameter count while varying width, depth, and attention heads. Our key finding is that model width, rather than depth or raw capacity, is the crucial factor for reliable grokking. Through extensive experiments, we show that wide-shallow transformers (256 dimensions, 8 heads) consistently outperform deep-narrow ones (4 layers, 32 dimensions) despite equal parameters, achieving perfect generalization on complex permutation tasks in 5490 steps where narrow models plateau at 7.5\% accuracy. These results provide concrete architectural guidelines for achieving grokking while revealing fundamental insights about how parameter distribution shapes a model's capacity to learn algorithmic patterns.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% Opening paragraph introducing grokking and its importance
Recent work has revealed an intriguing phenomenon in neural networks called ``grokking,'' where models suddenly achieve strong generalization long after reaching perfect training accuracy \citep{power2022grokking}. This behavior challenges our understanding of how neural networks learn and generalize, suggesting that the process of extracting underlying patterns from data may continue well after surface-level memorization. While grokking has been observed across various tasks, the specific architectural factors that enable or inhibit this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Prior work has established systematic relationships between model size, compute, and performance for language models \citep{Kaplan2020ScalingLF}, but similar scaling principles for grokking remain unexplored. Theoretical work has shown that wider neural networks exhibit more predictable training dynamics through the lens of Neural Tangent Kernel theory \citep{Jacot2018NeuralTK}, but these insights have not been systematically applied to grokking.

% Problem statement and challenges
Understanding how model architecture influences grokking is crucial for both theoretical insights and practical applications. The key challenge lies in systematically characterizing how different aspects of model capacity affect both the timing and reliability of grokking. We focus on transformer architectures \citep{vaswani2017attention}, investigating how depth, width, and attention mechanisms impact learning dynamics across tasks of varying complexity levels, from simple arithmetic to permutation composition.

% Our approach and methodology
We conduct a systematic empirical study comparing deep-narrow versus wide-shallow transformers while controlling for total parameter count. Our experimental framework uses a grid search over architectural parameters (1-4 layers, 32-256 dimensions, 2-8 attention heads) and groups models into capacity buckets based on parameter count. Through carefully designed arithmetic and permutation tasks, we probe how different architectural configurations affect learning trajectories and generalization capabilities.

% Summary of key findings with specific results
Our investigation reveals that model width is crucial for achieving reliable grokking. A small single-layer model (64 dimensions, 2 heads) can achieve grokking on simple arithmetic in 3090 steps, while deep-narrow architectures (4 layers, 32 dimensions) fail to converge reliably, reaching only 84\% validation accuracy. Most strikingly, on permutation composition tasks, wide models (256 dimensions, 8 heads) achieve perfect generalization in 5490 steps, while narrow models plateau at just 7.5\% validation accuracy despite having the same parameter count.

% Specific contributions with quantitative backing
The key contributions of our work are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Empirical evidence that wide-shallow architectures (2 layers, 256 dimensions) consistently outperform deep-narrow ones (4 layers, 32 dimensions) across all tasks
    \item Quantitative characterization showing wide models achieve 100\% validation accuracy on complex tasks where narrow models fail to surpass 10\%
    \item Practical guidelines demonstrating that doubling model width improves performance more than doubling depth
\end{itemize}

% Broader impact and paper organization
These findings provide concrete guidance for architecting models capable of grokking while illuminating fundamental relationships between model capacity and sudden generalization. Our results suggest that the distribution of parameters matters more than raw count, with width being essential for learning complex algorithmic patterns. The rest of this paper details our experimental methodology, presents comprehensive results across multiple tasks and architectures, and discusses implications for future research.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}
Our work intersects with three primary research directions in deep learning: grokking dynamics, architectural scaling, and algorithmic learning. While prior work has explored each area independently, we uniquely investigate their intersection through the lens of transformer architecture design.

The grokking phenomenon, where models suddenly generalize long after achieving perfect training accuracy, was first characterized by \citet{power2022grokking} using small MLPs on modular arithmetic. While they demonstrated grokking's existence, they did not systematically study architectural factors. \citet{Wang2024GrokkedTA} later showed transformers could exhibit grokking on reasoning tasks but focused on post-hoc analysis rather than architectural design. Our work differs by providing concrete architectural guidelines for achieving reliable grokking, showing that model width is the crucial factor.

Several studies have explored transformer architecture scaling. \citet{Kaplan2020ScalingLF} established that performance scales smoothly with model size in language tasks, while \citet{Hoffmann2022TrainingCL} showed compute-optimal scaling requires balanced depth/width ratios. However, these works focused on large-scale language modeling where memorization and generalization are difficult to disentangle. In contrast, we use controlled algorithmic tasks to isolate how width and depth affect generalization dynamics, finding that width is more important than previously suggested.

The closest to our work is \citet{Noci2023TheST}, who studied transformer scaling limits theoretically. While they predicted better conditioning in wide models, they did not empirically validate this on algorithmic tasks. Our results provide concrete evidence that wide-shallow transformers (256 dimensions) consistently outperform deep-narrow ones (32 dimensions) on permutation learning, achieving 100\% versus 7.5\% accuracy despite equal parameter counts. This demonstrates that parameter distribution matters more than raw capacity for algorithmic learning.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

The study of neural network generalization has been transformed by two key developments: the emergence of transformer architectures \citep{vaswani2017attention} and the discovery of grokking \citep{power2022grokking}. While transformers revolutionized sequence modeling through self-attention mechanisms, their learning dynamics remain incompletely understood. Recent theoretical work suggests that wider networks may exhibit more predictable training behavior through the lens of Neural Tangent Kernel theory \citep{Jacot2018NeuralTK, Lee2019WideNN}, though these insights have not been systematically applied to grokking.

Grokking describes a distinct phenomenon where neural networks achieve perfect training accuracy long before demonstrating true generalization \citep{power2022grokking}. This challenges classical learning theory, which typically assumes generalization improves monotonically with optimization \citep{Zhang2016UnderstandingDL}. The delayed emergence of generalization suggests a more complex relationship between optimization and learning, particularly for algorithmic tasks where the underlying patterns are highly structured.

\subsection{Problem Setting}
Let $\mathcal{X}$ be the space of input sequences and $\mathcal{Y}$ the space of target outputs. We study two classes of tasks:

\textbf{Modular Arithmetic:} For prime $p=97$, we define operations $\circ: \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_p$ where $\circ \in \{+, -, \div\}$. Each input $x \in \mathcal{X}$ is a sequence $(a, \circ, b, =)$ with $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ (requiring $b \neq 0$ for division), and the target $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ is $a \circ b \bmod p$.

\textbf{Permutation Composition:} For permutations on $k=5$ elements, each input contains two permutations $(\sigma_1, \circ, \sigma_2, =)$ where $\sigma_1, \sigma_2 \in S_k$, and the target is their composition $\sigma_1 \circ \sigma_2$.

We implement these tasks using transformer architectures with three key parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model depth $L \in \{1,2,4\}$ (number of transformer layers)
    \item Hidden dimension $d \in \{32,64,128,256\}$ (embedding/attention width)
    \item Attention heads $h \in \{2,4,8\}$ (parallel attention computations)
\end{itemize}

Following \citet{ba2016layer}, we use layer normalization and the AdamW optimizer \citep{loshchilov2017adamw} with weight decay 0.5. Models are trained with learning rate $10^{-3}$ and 50-step warmup to prevent premature convergence to memorized solutions.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Building on the theoretical framework introduced in Section~\ref{sec:background}, we systematically investigate how transformer architectures affect grokking through controlled experiments. Our approach focuses on isolating the impact of model capacity distribution while maintaining fixed parameter counts.

\subsection{Experimental Design}
For input space $\mathcal{X}$ and output space $\mathcal{Y}$ as defined in Section~\ref{sec:background}, we construct a grid of transformer configurations varying three key parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model depth $L \in \{1,2,4\}$ (number of transformer layers)
    \item Hidden dimension $d \in \{32,64,128,256\}$ (embedding/attention width)
    \item Attention heads $h \in \{2,4,8\}$ (parallel attention computations)
\end{itemize}

Each configuration processes input sequences $x \in \mathcal{X}$ of length 4 using learned token embeddings $E: \mathcal{V} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ and positional embeddings $P: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is our vocabulary. Following \citet{vaswani2017attention}, each layer applies masked self-attention followed by a position-wise feed-forward network:

\begin{equation}
    z_\ell = \text{LayerNorm}(x + \text{MHA}(x)) \quad \text{for } \ell = 1,\ldots,L
\end{equation}

where MHA denotes multi-head attention with $h$ heads. The final layer projects to logits over $\mathcal{Y}$.

\subsection{Training Protocol}
We train all models using AdamW optimization \citep{loshchilov2017adamw} with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning rate $\alpha = 10^{-3}$ with 50-step linear warmup
    \item Weight decay $\lambda = 0.5$
    \item Batch size $B = 512$
    \item Fixed budget of 7,500 optimization steps
\end{itemize}

Following \citet{power2022grokking}, we use a 50-50 train-validation split and evaluate every 10 steps using 8 batches (4,096 examples). We define grokking as achieving 99\% validation accuracy and run each configuration with 3 random seeds to assess stability.

Our experimental framework enables direct comparison of learning trajectories between architectures while controlling for total parameter count. This allows us to isolate how the distribution of capacity between width and depth affects both the speed and reliability of grokking across our arithmetic and permutation tasks.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}

We implement our experiments using PyTorch \citep{paszke2019pytorch} with two task families: modular arithmetic and permutation composition. For arithmetic tasks, we use prime modulus $p=97$ with operations $\circ \in \{+, -, \div\}$ on inputs $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ (requiring $b \neq 0$ for division). For permutation tasks, we compose permutations on $k=5$ elements, yielding 14,400 unique input pairs from $S_5 \times S_5$.

Each task's dataset is split 50-50 into training and validation sets. Models process 4-token input sequences $(a, \circ, b, =)$ and predict the operation result. We evaluate using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Training/validation accuracy and cross-entropy loss
    \item Steps to memorization (99\% training accuracy)
    \item Steps to grokking (99\% validation accuracy)
    \item Stability of generalization across 3 random seeds
\end{itemize}

Following our theoretical framework, we test transformer configurations varying three key parameters while controlling total parameter count:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model depth $L \in \{1,2,4\}$ transformer layers
    \item Hidden dimension $d \in \{32,64,128,256\}$ for embeddings and attention
    \item Attention heads $h \in \{2,4,8\}$ per layer
\end{itemize}

All models use learned token and positional embeddings, pre-layer normalization \citep{ba2016layer}, and GELU activations. Training uses AdamW optimization \citep{loshchilov2017adamw} with learning rate $10^{-3}$, weight decay 0.5, and 50-step linear warmup. Models process data in batches of 512 examples for 7,500 total optimization steps.

We evaluate every 10 steps using 8 validation batches (4,096 examples) to obtain reliable statistics. This protocol enables direct comparison of learning trajectories between architectures while maintaining fixed compute budgets. Results in Section~\ref{sec:results} report means and standard errors across 3 random seeds per configuration.

\subsection{Dataset Construction}
For modular arithmetic tasks with prime $p=97$, we generate all possible input pairs $(a,b)$ where $a \in \{0,\ldots,96\}$ and:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Division: $b \in \{1,\ldots,96\}$, yielding 9,409 unique examples
    \item Addition/Subtraction: $b \in \{0,\ldots,96\}$, yielding 9,506 unique examples
\end{itemize}
For permutation tasks with $k=5$, we consider all possible pairs from the 120 unique permutations, resulting in 14,400 unique compositions. Following \citet{power2022grokking}, we randomly split each dataset 50-50 into training and validation sets.

\subsection{Training Configuration}
Models are trained using AdamW optimizer \citep{loshchilov2017adamw} with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning rate: $10^{-3}$ with 50-step linear warmup
    \item Weight decay: 0.5
    \item Batch size: 512
    \item Training steps: 7,500
    \item Random seeds: 3 per configuration
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}
We evaluate models every 10 steps on both training and validation sets using 8 batches (4,096 examples) per evaluation. Key metrics include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Training/validation loss (cross-entropy)
    \item Training/validation accuracy
    \item Steps to memorization (99\% train accuracy)
    \item Steps to grokking (99\% val accuracy)
\end{itemize}

Our results show wide models (256 dimensions, 8 heads) achieve perfect generalization on permutation tasks in 5,490 steps, while narrow models (32 dimensions, 2 heads) plateau at 7.5\% accuracy despite similar parameter counts. These findings are visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:first_figure}, which shows the training dynamics across different architectural configurations.
\subsection{Dataset Construction}
For modular arithmetic tasks, we generate all possible pairs of inputs $(a,b)$ where $a \in \{0,\ldots,96\}$ and $b \in \{1,\ldots,96\}$ for division, and $b \in \{0,\ldots,96\}$ for addition and subtraction. This yields 9,409 unique examples for division and 9,506 for addition/subtraction. For permutation tasks with $k=5$, we consider all possible pairs from the 120 unique permutations, resulting in 14,400 unique compositions. Following \citet{power2022grokking}, we randomly split each dataset 50-50 into training and validation sets.

% Training details and hyperparameters
\subsection{Training Configuration}
Each model is trained for exactly 7,500 optimization steps using AdamW with base learning rate $10^{-3}$ and weight decay 0.5. We employ a linear learning rate warmup over the first 50 steps to stabilize initial training. Models process data in batches of 512 examples, with gradients computed using standard cross-entropy loss. To ensure reliable results, we train each architectural configuration with 3 different random seeds and report means with standard errors.

% Evaluation protocol and metrics
\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}
We evaluate models every 10 training steps on both training and validation sets, computing loss and accuracy metrics. For each evaluation, we process 8 full batches (4,096 examples) to obtain reliable statistics. We track four key metrics throughout training: training loss, validation loss, training accuracy, and validation accuracy. Following standard practice, we consider a model to have memorized when it achieves 99\% training accuracy and to have grokked when it achieves 99\% validation accuracy.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Our systematic investigation reveals that model width, rather than depth, is the key factor enabling reliable grokking. Through controlled experiments with matched parameter counts ($\sim$100K parameters), we find that wide-shallow transformers consistently outperform deep-narrow ones across all tasks.

\subsection{Training Dynamics}
The wide model (2 layers, 256 dimensions, 8 heads) achieved remarkably low final training losses: $0.00204 \pm 0.00047$ on division and $0.00113 \pm 0.00011$ on permutation tasks. In contrast, deep-narrow architectures (4 layers, 32 dimensions) showed significantly higher losses ($0.1245 \pm 0.0441$) and failed to achieve perfect memorization on permutation tasks, plateauing at $98.00\% \pm 0.86\%$ training accuracy.

\subsection{Task-Specific Performance}
On modular arithmetic ($p=97$), models exhibited distinct learning trajectories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Division: Wide models reached 99\% validation accuracy in $4013 \pm 163$ steps with final validation loss $0.00303 \pm 0.00062$
    \item Addition: Fastest convergence at $2673 \pm 59$ steps, lowest final validation loss $0.00179 \pm 0.00007$
    \item Subtraction: Intermediate difficulty requiring $4106 \pm 159$ steps, final validation loss $0.00538 \pm 0.00013$
\end{itemize}

The permutation composition task revealed stark architectural differences. Wide models achieved perfect generalization (100\% validation accuracy) in $5490$ steps with $0.00158 \pm 0.00016$ validation loss, while narrow models plateaued at $7.5\% \pm 0.06\%$ accuracy despite equal parameter counts.

\subsection{Ablation Studies}
Our experiments systematically varied three architectural parameters while controlling total parameter count:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Depth: Increasing from 1 to 4 layers showed minimal benefit without sufficient width
    \item Width: Doubling from 32 to 64 dimensions improved validation accuracy more than doubling depth
    \item Heads: 8 attention heads proved optimal for permutation tasks, while arithmetic tasks performed well with 4
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
While our results demonstrate the importance of width for grokking, several limitations warrant discussion:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scale: Results may not generalize to significantly larger tasks or models
    \item Compute: Wide models incur quadratic cost in attention computation
    \item Architecture: Deeper models might exhibit different width-depth trade-offs
    \item Task Scope: Limited to arithmetic and permutation tasks of moderate size
\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Our systematic investigation of transformer architectures reveals that model width, rather than depth or raw parameter count, is the crucial factor enabling reliable grokking. Through controlled experiments comparing architectures with matched parameters ($\sim$100K), we found that wide-shallow transformers (2 layers, 256 dimensions) consistently outperform deep-narrow ones (4 layers, 32 dimensions) across all tasks. Most strikingly, on permutation composition tasks, wide models achieved perfect generalization in 5,490 steps with final validation loss of 0.0016, while narrow models plateaued at 7.5\% accuracy.

The superior stability of wide models provides key theoretical insights into the relationship between architecture and learning dynamics. While narrow architectures showed high variance across seeds (validation accuracy 0.57-0.99 on division), wide models maintained consistent performance with standard errors below 0.1\% on arithmetic tasks. This stability, combined with significantly lower loss values (0.002 vs 0.124 training loss), suggests that wider attention mechanisms create more robust internal representations of algorithmic patterns.

These findings open three promising directions for future work: (1) investigating how width requirements scale with task complexity, particularly for larger permutation groups, (2) analyzing the interaction between model width and optimization dynamics to understand why wide models achieve more stable convergence, and (3) developing theoretical frameworks that explain the role of width in learning algorithmic patterns by examining attention mechanisms in successful versus failed models. Such work could bridge the gap between empirical observations of grokking and fundamental theories of neural network learning.
